At first, commanders felt the suppression of the guerrillas to be a function of the police. Later, when it became obvious the police could not restore order, the military commanders were forced to take the field. However, even after guerrilla activities had turned the Balkans into a theater of war, only intelligence reports carried the designations of guerrilla units; commanders still referred to these forces in their headquarters diaries as \"bands.\" Not until 1944, when the guerrillas were threatening to drive him from the Balkans altogether, Field Marshal von Weichs acknowledge their strength and direct that reference be made to the guerrilla units as divisions, corps and other designations, rather than as \"bands.\"”\r\n",

The \"Super Swing Golf Pangya\" uses the wii remote to give the player semi-realistic golf swing. I rented it and it was quite fun and felt accurate (perhaps too accurate for me). Golf's not my thing so I didn't end up buying it but I if you're into golf simulations no other console can touch wii when it comes to golf sims and \"Super Swing\" is the living proof.

We can safely say that developers are already starting to get comfortable with the features of the wiimote and it will only get better with time.

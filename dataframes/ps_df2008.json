The important distinction here in that Governments are (ideally) a manifestation of altruism, while business are a manifestation of greed or self-interest. I'm not making a value judgment here, by the way. Both altruism and greed\/sefl-interest are fundamental psychological drivers, and both have their place.\n\nI see what you mean, and it is a valid stand point. Both profit and altruism have their fair share of problems though. With profit it can lead to unethical acts to increase profits, with altruism it can be over protective and at some point lead to self interest. What I mean by that is that being overly protective means people lose their freedom, it makes sense when you think of it as if people don't have freedom they can not hurt themselves or others. For the other aspect is when some one thinks they should be king of the world because they will use that power to protect every one, they are afraid that other bad people are seeking power to hurt people and that it is up to them to protect them by going after that power. So at some point some one thinks that they need to gain wealth and power in order to help others, and their willing to do unethical things to achieve it, they think the ends justify the means.\n\n&gt;If you were viewing Government as a business, these would be \"unprofitable\" and likely shut down.\n\nNot necessarily. Businesses for example will sometimes do things that are unprofitable to keep customers happy, while they compensate by being profitable by other means. For example, in the gaming industry, companies like Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, sell game consoles at a loss losing money for each console sold which means they are more affordable to their customers (Sony was losing $300 per playstation 3). Where they make their money back is in people buying the video games for their console. Apple does this as well with its iPhone, it makes up it's cost through an agreement with AT&amp;T.\n\nAnother example is that some companies have tiered pricing, where they have different prices for their service. To some extent it is almost like welfare, they want to have a lot of customers because it combats their competition and they charge other customers higher price in order to afford charging other customers lower prices. Sometimes the differences are small between the lower cost services and the higher cost ones.\n\nThis is kind of what the government does, it taxes some people more for it's services then it does other people, but again the exception is that no one has the freedom to opt out of it if they don't like the quality of service.\n\n&gt;But part of the purpose of Government, in my view, is to provide these services no matter what.\n\nBut that can be a down side, and is kind of why our government is in so much debt. It is not being realistic, it is living beyond it's means, and it is hurting the economy as a result. It should do this with in reason.\n\n&gt;From a purely fiscal point of view, its just throwing money away. From a societal point of view, though, the benefits are obvious.\n\nIf it is done right it benefits society, if it is done wrong people are just taking advantage of it and are not improving society, rather they are just draining it.\n\n","c02ufxe":"On a previous reddit post about this, GOP water-carrier shiner_man [dismissed it](http:\/\/politics.reddit.com\/info\/63ik7\/comments\/c02ps35) as an isolated incident that doesn't reflect how the government operates.

We talked about this in one of my classes... \n\nCheap cell phones, laptops and playstations have become a major part of western culture at the expense of the Congolese.  Most of the fighting is motivated by ethnic strife, but to finance their wars they fight for the Coltan mines.  MNCs don't care who controls the mine as long as the Coltan flows and they can keep prices on electronics low.  \n\nAs a result, consumers indirectly fund the strife there, because of the demand for cheap electronics.  If you knew that buying a product was directly related to the killings of thousands of Congolese would you still buy that product?

I agree, let them sort out their shit, but our desire for cheap cellphones, laptops and playstations fuels the problems there.  It has to do with columbite-tantalum, or coltan, which is found in most electronics we use today.  Think of Coltan as the Oil for the electronic industry, and Congo holds 80-90% of the world's supply.  Militias take over the mines to finance their wars, and MNCs get Coltan on the cheap to supply our electronics demand.  Consumers pay the corporations, the corporations payoff the militias.  If something goes wrong, we end up with a shortage of electronics like when playstations first arrived, but they didn't have enough to meet demand.  It's because they couldn't control the supply.\n\nSo... the people that die every month in Congo is very much within your sphere if you've ever bought and used a cell phone to check in with your family, or a laptop to check this post.\n\nSource: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Game-Old-Empire-Economic-Corruption\/dp\/1576753956\/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201109690&amp;sr=8-1\nAlso:\nhttp:\/\/www.cellular-news.com\/coltan\/","c02z3de":"Try tons of [Coltan](http:\/\/www.cellular-news.com\/coltan\/)\n\nColtan is used in many electronics like cellphones, laptops and playstations\n\nFrom source:\nThe tech boom caused the price of Coltan to rocket to as high as US$600 per kilogram at one point, compared to a previous value of US$65 per kilogram, although it has settled down to around US$100 per kilogram at the moment.

I came from a really poor family and the anger of not being able to afford things that others around me could manifested itself in the worst way.  First year I worked I was making more than my parents combined.  I got a car, clothes, huge TV, playstation, 600$ pair of skis, etc...  racking up debt like there was no tomorrow, except there was. \n\nI attribute that early-adult-life spending spree to me trying to reaffirm myself in a world of consumption. All the things I bought were some form of vengeance against the unfairness of my childhood.  I never had a gaming console but most my friends had.  I now had the biggest collection of games and biggest TV to play with.\n\nI ended up defaulting and they upped the interest rate on all my credit cards.   Banks and credit cards do their best to give you as much loan money as possible.  Once they've got you in loans up to your neck they pretty much own you.  Everything you do is for them.  Once you default on a single loan your credit card rate changes and it's all downhill from there.  I became their bitch.\n\nI was lucky that I had been able to find a great job in France where getting a loan isn't too hard to do even if you defaulted in another country.  There is no such thing as a credit history there.   I was able to get a good loan to consolidate all my defaulted payments and spent the good part of a year paying it all off.\n\nIt was the last loan I took out and now that I'm back in Canada with a fixed credit history.  I now carry a credit card with a 500$ limit on it.   I use it to screw the banks out of transaction fees.  I don't pay any interest on my VISA or transaction fees to the bank.  They hate me for it.\n\nI saved up so much in the last few years by being as frugal as I could that I was able to put a 20% down payment on my first house.  The same banker offered me a loan I didn't want and a credit margin at the same rate as the mortgage.  I told him flat out that I refused to have them both.  I told him I'd do the renovations with my cash flow.  He can't make money off of me if I refuse his loans.  \n\nThe bank is my bitch now.","c03c2fq":"You actually think people stupid enough to keep having children they can't possibly afford are going to spend the money that the government (a.k.a. taxpayers) gives them wisely?

I'm more of a wii-type gamer myself, but it seems like with the gaming industry Microsoft has a foothold in software, development and online capabilities that don't come as naturally to their Japanese competitors. On the other hand, I've read that xbox games run more or less like PC games, but that the playstation 3 cell architecture will be extremely powerful once developers get a grip on it and start making use of it. PS3 bombed out the gate and the games were mostly ports that played the same on the xbox 360, but the PS3 is getting cheaper all the time, and developers and consumers could easily start to grow into the new technology as they are with blu-ray.\n\nBut all these good and bad points aside, they're just a company now. Last year, when I said Apple was on the move Microsoft fans just laughed it off, but at the rate things are going they need to stop laughing.

You only have to step onto epics or any UT forum to see the problems with it.  \n\nAnd the fact that you cant play pirated UT online means that people would definitely pay for it, if only it weren't a poorly ported, console orientated, failure.","c03jp6z":"I have a PS3 and a 360, and I also commented in the original article saying that, at the moment, my playtime is slightly in favor of the 360.  There were a couple of factors that didn't really get taken into account though in this article that really affect how much play time each console gets for me:\n\nMost of the games that I have for the 360 are bigger in scope than the PS3 games that I have.  Although Devil May Cry 4 (which I own for PS3), Folklore, and Ratchet and Clank are all great games, Lost Odyssey on the 360 is sucking up a lot of my time.  Before Lost Odyssey, a lot of my time on the 360 was playing Oblivion, which is a massive game and a huge timesink.\n\nThe Xbox Live Marketplace is also a huge factor in how often I use the 360.  There are a few really great games on the Xbox Live Arcade that I play whenever I want to sit down and game for 15 or 20 minutes (usually Worms or Metal Slug at the moment).  The PSN offers fewer games, and most of them aren't very appealing.  Plus for some weird reason like 2\/3 of the games on the PSN require the playstation eye.  I'm not sure what's up with that.\n\nAlthough the PS3 gets used for most of my DVD playing now days, the xbox 360 also gets a big chunk of time for the video marketplace.  Since I don't have a DVR or cable tv, I buy shows off the video marketplace if there is something that I really want to keep up with (I bought all of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles off the video marketplace...damn I hope they renew that show for another season)\n\nI buy all multiplatform games on the PS3 both because of the RRoD issue, as well as my personal preference for the PS3 controller over the 360 controller (no flames please, I know a lot of people prefer the 360 controller, I just find it a little bulky and prefer the smaller form factor of the sixaxis)\n\nI'm interested to see what happens with Home, but at the moment I'm approaching it with reserved optimism, because I think there is the definite possibility of it devolving into a prettier secondlife.\n\nAll said and done, I think that the PS3 is the better console, and I like the approach Sony is taking with it, but the maturity of the 360 and the larger amount of content on Live is compelling enough to keep the 360 relevant.  As the PS3 matures over the next year or so, I think sony has the opportunity to bust out and overtake the 360, but they are currently sitting on too much untapped potential.","c03jr1y":"Neither.

Nintendo clearly has a market that it caters to and has shied away from it. Only hardcore ps3\/360 owners would be thoroughly concerned about hardware specs - yes, the Wii may be an overclocked Gamecube but does that make any of the games any less fun?\n\nNot really, no.","c03jt1b":"[surprised chair is surprised](http:\/\/www.pointytriangles.com\/bongrips4obama\/images\/suprisedchair.jpg)","c03jt72":"[surprised chair is surprised](http:\/\/www.pointytriangles.com\/bongrips4obama\/images\/suprisedchair.jpg)","c03jt76":"[surprised chair is surprised](http:\/\/www.pointytriangles.com\/bongrips4obama\/images\/suprisedchair.jpg)","c03jt7d":"[surprised chair is surprised](http:\/\/www.pointytriangles.com\/bongrips4obama\/images\/suprisedchair.jpg)","c03jt7g":"[surprised chair is surprised](http:\/\/www.pointytriangles.com\/bongrips4obama\/images\/suprisedchair.jpg)","c03jt7o":"[surprised chair is surprised](http:\/\/www.pointytriangles.com\/bongrips4obama\/images\/suprisedchair.jpg)","c03k3jc":"Or switch them around if they are using ps2.

And I never hear any of this talk about C++ being difficult or lacking in functionality, except from web developers. But I do sense a change coming. Not so much that language preferences are changing but that target platforms are changing.\n\nThe answer to the question is we use C++ because it's the best choice for real time simulation games on 360, ps3, and wii.\n\nBut it seems inevitable that stand alone game consoles will go away in the future to be replaced by browsers using PI libs which provide all the graphics, audio, and cpu power of something like the 360. At that point the entire development process has been recreated from scratch and C++ will probably not survive as the best choice.\n\nThe change has already happened for casual games, right? Nobody makes casual games as stand alone C++ windows or mac apps anymore. They're now mostly java and run in a browser on any system.","c03p2tl":"that thing is fucking massive.

We use lua which is pretty damn fast at least according to these benchmark comparisons (http:\/\/www.timestretch.com\/FractalBenchmark.html)\n\nBut designers\/scripters try to do a lot of work in lua and most of the time we end up taking their code and converting it to c++, or reimplementing their systems in c++. Especially in a high end game where you have physics, animation state handling, ai pathing, etc. I mean most of the time what it comes down to is how much we can do in what we are given, do we really want to spend CPU time running a HLL language simply because of language preference, or do we want more and\/or smarter AI NPCs running around, giving us more time in a frame to do more stuff to deepen the players experience.\n\nHigh performance game development is largely about resource management, managing memory allocation, how many raycasts per frame, how many ai brains think per frame, how many a-star paths are done per frame, how many objects to draw per frame, managing how data is stored in order to quickly find the data you are looking for. The idea behind HLL is to have less management, automatic garbage collection is a perfect example of that, as well as not having static typing.\n\nHow we mostly use HLL is for scripters and designers to trigger events or change states of things based upon conditions.\n\nIt would be nice if any language (HLL or not) would optimize things in our game as good or better then what we can possibly do, but that is just not possible currently. You could try to apply what I have said with assembly programming, but C\/C++ abstract away some things that would be tedious to do in assembly, such as object oriented programming and the use of templates to reduce code redundancy, it's not just about ease of programming it's also about reduction of bugs, but again the one thing that C++ has over HLL is it's ability to allow people to do low level optimizations for specific platforms, I can use intrinsics special to the 360 or ps3 to get a boost in performance, I can have static types.\n","c03pfja":"it is absurd to me that airplane manufacturers have fan boys.

I still can't help being very concerned from the user side about it, especially as I'm a user without Flash on my main desktop.  There remains only one source for a fully-functional player and they _intentionally impede_ the development of a compatible player even for the target architectures they don't or won't officially support.\n\n&gt; ok, think WEB APPS not web sites.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does it matter if you can't run it on a ps3 or a wii? Seriously? c'mon.\n\nIt really comes down to what developers put in that \"web app\" category.  The mere existence of Flash-only web sites makes it obvious that there is still disagreement about what fits.\n\nFor interacting with internal business data on a company LAN, sure the PS3\/Wii has no forseeable impact.  And as I mentioned the company can always provide their employees with equipment to make it work.\n\nBut as soon as you bring applications for home users into the picture -- webmail, discussion forums, online shopping, weather, mapping, banking, 401k management, etc, it becomes a very different situation.  Especially if these tasks are something the user might be interested in doing from their couch, where the game console is the most readily available browser.\n","c03qfyu":"Me too!

Doesn't work with universal remotes.\nSony decided not to include an IR receptor on the PlayStation 3, and home theater fans have been complaining ever since. The lack of an IR receptor means that the PlayStation 3 won't work with universal remote controls, so you'll have to use the PS3 controller or the separate PS3 BD remote to control it. It's definitely a pain for anyone who is used to activity-based macros such as \"Watch TV\" and \"Watch Blu-ray\" to control their home theater.\n\nYou can get a IR dongle for ps3\n\n&gt;2. It's louder than standalones.\nAlthough every PS3 seems to be different, the PS3 can occasionally get loud once its fans start spinning. For audiophiles, that can be a pretty big drawback, especially if you start to hear a whirr during every quiet scene in a movie. You'll have better luck keeping the PS3 quiet by keeping it in a well-ventilated area, but standalones are quieter in general and don't mind having other gear stacked on them.\n\nWhat are you talking about?! The ps3 is dead silent.\n\n&gt;3. Interface isn't as easy to use.\nThis isn't an issue for tech enthusiasts, but Sony's Xross Media Bar (XMB) is packed with options and can be intimidating for neophytes. Although we generally like the XMB for zipping around the PS3's functions, using a standard Blu-ray player where you just need to put in the disc and hit play is definitely a lot easier.\n\nBy default the ps3 will play a disk in the drive. The XMB is extremely simple to use, and is all laid out for you. No searching randomly to find something. Also the XMB is comming to new TVS and other devices.\n\n&gt; 5. You want to be green.\nThe PS3 is great at a lot of things, but conserving power isn't one of them. If you're looking to stay green and limit your power consumption, you'll be much better off using a standalone Blu-ray player. For example, the PS3 sucks up about 170 watts while playing a Blu-ray movie, while the Samsung BD-P1400 only uses about 25 watts. That's a fairly huge difference and can easily wipe out any power savings from using other green products such as the Philips Eco TV. (Check out our guide to TV power consumption for more green tips.)\n\nIf you have an HD-TV I think being green is the least of your concerns. \n\n&gt;6. I need to see my receiver light up and say \"Dolby TrueHD.\"\nEven if you do have a new HDMI-capable receiver, you'll never get the Dolby TrueHD light to turn on with the PS3. That's because although the PS3 can decode both DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD, it can't send those soundtracks in bit stream format and allow the receiver to decode them. Of course, this isn't really a legitimate reason, as you're still getting the same high-resolution audio, but some people just need the comfort of seeing the Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio lights on their receiver.\n\n\nYou're an idiot.","c03zyvk":"i know for a fact there are problems with ps3's firmware.  ever since one of the updates a few months back everytime i turn on my ps3 it fucks up my router and also it says i don't have upnp which works perfectly fine on my computer...","c03zzuk":"I have a launch ps3.

They actually use the shoulder buttons to fire and the triggers change weapons.  No, this is not changeable in the configuration.","c040ih1":"Yeah, but that's the \"official\" playstation magazine...it's like Smash Bros Brawl getting a 10\/10 from *Nintendo Power.*","c040kpn":"crap article.

The wii is *still* sold out in places. It is a huge success here.\n\nYour correct that the highest selling Wii games are 1st party titles, and that xbox owners buy more games per console than the Wii, but then I never disputed that.\n\nYour last statement is wrong though.  If a consoles popularity was measured on games sales, then every console would still be losing to the ps2.  Popularity of a console is, by definition, the sales of the console.

Oh yeah, the cat too.","c047a2s":"Wouldn't Linux represent less than 2% of ATI's market? Considering that ATI makes the graphics chips for all of the graphics chips for this current generation of consoles (even the ps3 has some ATI chips in it) the numbers for Linux are even less. Say Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony each sell 20 million, 4 million and 5 million consoles this year. Now say Apple sells 4 million Macs this year of which about half come with an ATI card so 2 million cards for ATI. If the Mac is 6% of the desktop market that means 125.2 million Windows based PCs are sold this year which half of have ATI cards (ignoring Intel and other card manufactures). Now if Linux is 2% of the market (which seems a bit high to me but I'm going to run with it) and, once again, half of those guys have ATI cards then that's only 600,000 cards. Add all the projected cards sold and you end up with about 0.6% of the market being Linux people.\n\nIf you assume that ATI has 100 people who make drivers (number pulled out of my ass because it's a nice even number) evenly distributed to reflect their market then you end up with one guy who spends only part of his time making Linux drivers. If you start to take into account that quite a few Linux PCs sold use the cheapest video components that can be found (ie NOT ATI or Nvidia) or are just corporate workstations where the video cards is the last thing to be upgraded it's a miracle that Linux is even supported at all. The fact that Linux is such an statistical non-entity yet gets on the box says to me that Linux users should stop biting the hand that feeds them. If you want to make more of an impact that would justify getting decent drivers you should buy 5 high end cards (the us$500+ kind) and encourage the other thousands of Linux consumers to do the same. If you can get half of the number of one of the consoles then you'll get real drivers.","c047e12":"lol she's talkin about ps3 owners :P","c047pg1":"Let the ps3 owner's enjoy what we've already played a year ago.

The PS3 might have something like that besides oblivion (also for ps3 as well). I know that game is also for PC as well but try to put a game like that on the wii is impossible becuase the GPU is shit compared to even the xbox1. \n\nThe wii is gimmacky and the games are shallow. Yet it sells like hotcakes becuase of the bored soccer moms. Why is nintendo abandoning it's core gamers and focusing on milking mario and making more expensive yoga boards.

Honestly, since getting the PS3 I havn't even touched my 360, it's still in the box from the last time I moved. The only thing that keeps calling to me is Call Of Duty 4, and that just isn't worth the extra clutter of cords. In summary: xbox exclusives aren't THAT great, dead rising is pretty fun but halo? gears of war? you've played these games, they're nothing special.","c04fvka":"I got the 360 at launch, and I used it fairly often until I got my ps3 a little over a year ago. I only use my 360 for rock band and the occasional downloadable game every now and then.\n\nI get almost all multiplatform titles for PS3, mainly because of the superior controller.  Also, the system menus are much more visually pleasing and seem to flow smoother. The 360s blades seem antiquated compared to the PS3s XMB. \n\nThe PS3 has a number of games that I would probably not normally have played, some of which were on the previously mentioned list. Heavenly Sword was a (short) blast, Resistance was one of the best shooters I've played, and some of the downloadable games are breathtaking - especially Everyday Shooter. And of course MGS4 is amazing! The ps2 back catalogue is a must mention as well...\n\nI also like the media features, which previously ranked extremely low on my priorities when choosing a console . The DVD\/Bluray player is vastly superior to the 360 player in terms of navigation and ease of menu usage if you dont own the respective console's extra remote control. The PS3 video and music playback is seamless and well integrated, allowing for a simplicity that often finds me playing albums on my tv (with the awesome visualizations) rather than opening my laptop and loading up clunky itunes.\n\nIntegration with the PSP is also alot of fun if you have one. Features like remote play and downloadable handheld content were once novelties, but are finally coming into their own.\n\nThe network support, while not quite reaching xbox live levels, is always improving. The newly redesigned store is wonderful, and multiplayer is usually fine as long as you have patience.\n\nOverall, I enjoy both systems, but find the PS3 far more satisfying on numerous levels. Alot of my points might not apply to you now (psp, online, etc.) but keep in mind you'll have this system for years to come, so theres plenty of features to grow into over time.

I don't play online much, and a lot of my favorite games at the moment are either PS3 exclusives (MGS4, Devil May Cry 4, Ratchet and Clank) or multiplatform (GTA4, Oblivion) and I prefer the ps3 controller.\n\nOn the other hand, I use the 360 for media far more than the PS3.  Although the PS3 has nice upscaling, and I have a few bluray movies, I really like being able to rent movies and buy tv shows off the xbox live marketplace.\n\nI also tend to play the 360 more for quick games off Xbox Live Arcade, since a lot of the games on the PSN are crappy, and the selection is a lot smaller.","c04grvp":"I can't really say I am sad for this guy.

When I plugged it in it sounded like I had turned a hair dryer on.  When I started to play the football game it froze up.  I thought maybe it needs to be turned on it's side, so I did.  Mid-turn I heard it scratch my friends football game.\n\nSo with all of these concerns I googled and read about the known defects of the box.\n\nWhen I tried the ps3 it didn't have the cool online part, but it worked and was quiter.\n\nI haven't had one problem with my ps3.\n\nMoral of the story, if you read up before your purchase you wouldn't have a broken gaming system.

Most people expected that MGS4 would be a system seller, and would significantly increase the number of consoles sold during the month of it's release; especially since the wii did not have any comperable major releases.\n\n&gt; The Nintento Wii is a new and fun experience. It's innovative and opens up a whole new world of games from Wii sports to Wii Fit to what ever. It's even backwards compatible with the Gamecube and its controllers and memory card.\n\nThe wii is a fairly unique experience at first, but in reality it's not all that innovative.  From a technological standpoint, the only thing nintendo has really done is take existing technology and make it affordable.  All of the pointing and motion sensing technology used in the wii has been available for years.  The system architecture is basically just an overclocked gamecube.  Most of the games would play no different with a mouse or standard controller.\n\n&gt;All in All, it's a fun, affordable entertainment system. The fun may wear off after a few months but that's irrelevant.\n\nThe wii certainly does have enough good games to qualify as fun and affordable for a short period of time, but console wars are marathons, not sprints, and unless nintendo is able to do somethign to counteract the shovelware and get some better titles on the system, the wii is doomed to be nothing more than a really common doorstop.\n\n&gt; The PS3 is impressive. It has beautiful graphics, BlueRay player, great online stuff but...well...it's a PS3. A slightly better PS2. That's a slightly better PS1. That's a slightly better SNES. Where is the innovation, where is the fun?\n\nand a ferrari is just a slightly better version of a horse and buggy.  It's disingenuous to pretend that you cant recognize the significant architectural leaps in game consoles over the last 15 years.  Ideas from the PS2 were certainly used in the PS3, but the cell processor was a huge step forward in processor design.  We've only started to see hints of what can be built on top of next-gen systems.  It's not just about prettier and higher resolution graphics, it's about better physics and AI, and more immersive, more connected worlds.\n\n&gt; Sorry but I've got Metal Gear Solid 1, 2 and 3. Metal Gear solid 4 would be good if I wasn't bored from having done it all before.\n\nBig name franchises are big money spinners, a lot of people still like playing the next metal gear solid, grand turismo, etc.  That's not to say that there aren't new games being released as well.  Games like Echochrome, LittleBigPlanet, and Flow bring new ideas to gaming, while new franchises like Resistance FoM, Folklore, etc. bring new takes on classic genres.  The PS3 has plenty of \"just another release of game X\" titles, but so does the wii have far more than it's share of 'just another minigame collection'\n\n&gt; I've played Gran Turismo 1, 2, 3 and 4. There is nothing left to offer anybody. A PS3 offers fractionally better 90s games. \n\nsee above.  you can't speak for everyone, plenty of people still like the traditional genres, and it's not as though everything on the wii is groundbreaking, the wii just favors rehashes in a few specific genres.\n\n&gt; The game building techniques haven't changed.\n\nOn the contrary, there have been a number of improvements in game development techniques.  I would say that if any system was going to be accused of lack of innovation in this area though, it would be the wii, the system with the most ports of last-gen titles.\n\n&gt; The stories haven't improved. \n\nIn the SNES era, most games didn't even have stories.  In the PS1 era, the stories were generally fairly weak and hokey.  It's only been toward the end of the PS2 era and the beginning of the current generation that we have starting to see truly amazing film and novel quality storylines in games like GTA4, Assassins Creed, etc.\n\n&gt; It's just the same shit with better textures. Look at the control pads. That is the improvement in 20 years of keeping the SNES control pad style.\n\nControl pads work.  There are a large set of games that have control schemes that simply don't work with only 1 or 2 buttons, and the wii has provided ample evidence that waggling a remote at the screen is not always a superior solution.  Also, controls have really nothing to do with texture resolution.\n\n&gt; Sony got into this gig by doing a cheap console that's easy for people to write games for. \n\nActually, no.  During the PS1 era, all the systems were hard to program for, because nobody really got 3D, although the PS1 was considered easier than the N64 because of the larger size of CDs, and a better texture memory architecture.  Still, of the last-gen systems, the PS2 was notoriously hard to develop for, much more difficult than the gamecube or the xbox.  I think you are really thinking of Microsoft here, who benefitted both from a cost perspective and an ease of development perspective by using pretty much bog-standard x86 pc hardware for the original xbox.\n\n&gt; No \"Nintendo seal of approval\" bullshit. \n\nYes; one of the lessons Nintendo learned from Sony was the benefit of being more open to different types of games.  Sony does quality testing, just like Nintendo and Microsoft.  Up until the PS1 era though, Nintendo had a huge stranglehold over the types of games that could be released.  Sony took more gambles and in doing so allowed games that introduced a number of new genres.  If you are going to keep beating the 'innovation' dead horse, then really you should look at that bit of history.\n\n&gt; Now they are trying to pedal some \"entertainment\" system that has cool black lines and nothing new to offer. \n\nSony and Microsoft are both on the 'home media center' bandwagon, while Nintendo is remaining resolutely in the 'just games' camp.  The better strategy remains to be seen, but it certainly looks like there are a lot of people who are interested in having a single appliance in their entertainment center to handle photos, music, movies, downloads, PVR functionality, and games.\n\n&gt; I don't care if it has a hard disk (that's just the same as a memory card) or a BlueRay player (that's just a better VCD player) or an Internet connection (thats just a better serial link cable \/ multitap).\n\nOnce again, this is just completely disingenuous.  Hard drive capability is there as an enabling technology to make the digital media center aspect of the systems work.  Plenty of people might not care much about bluray yet, but saying it's just a better VCR is like saying that a VCR is just a better version of a flip-book; and if the internet is nothing new or worthwhile, what are you doing on reddit?  Online play might not be new, but it is a major feature that is finally getting prime-time among both Microsoft and Sony.  Online functionality is also being explored in more unique ways than just to enable remote multiplayer.  We are only beginning to see the start of what real internet-enabled gameplay will be in the future.\n\n&gt; The games are boring and have been done to death. It's always classic genres and nothing we haven't already seen. Sure I could waste my life in COD4 but if it never came out, I'd still be content firing up Unreal Tournament.\n\nI've mentioned before that there are new and innovative titles available on the PS3 and 360.\n\n&gt; People need a reason to buy a console and I can't see a single game worth buying on the PS3 that can't be gotten on the PS2\n\nWell, there are very few specific games available for both the PS2 and PS3, and in those cases, generally the PS2 port was done by a third party and is of lesser quality.  Of course, you are actually trying to make the implication that there is no innovation and that games on current-gen systems are merely clones of last-gen titles.  I've attempted already to show why this isn't true.\n\nIn closing; there are some innovative aspects to the Wii, just as there are innovative aspects to the PS3.  Both consoles have some unique and interesting games, and both consoles have their share of crappy games.  The wii inparticular has a horrendous problem with shovelware, and at this point has done very little to prove the validity of it's controller - which is the closes thing to innovative that the system has.  Wii Sports is one of the few games that makes real use of the full motion sensing capabilities of the system; most other games use the wiimote as a mouse, and occasionally tack on some additional motion sensing, and in most cases do so fairly poorly.  Games like Wii Fit may be innovative, but speak no more to the inherent innovativeness of the system than games like Guitar Hero or Sing Star, or Eye of Judgement; since the wii balance board is an extra parephrial.  The wii does have some good games, but the best of them could easily be played with a standard controller, and might be better off for it.  Wii Ware may improve the situation, but as it stands, games for the playstation network and the xbox live arcade offer far more room for innovation from indy developers than the wii has shown.\n\nSpeaking as someone who owns all three current-gen systems, I think that most of the standard pro-wii rhetoric is misguided.  There are certainly areas where the wii excels (a cheap system with a few fun casual games, not much of anything with depth, and mostly a new spin on traditional arcade and carnival style titles, easy to pick up for non-gamers) but sticking by the \"wii is the only innovative system\" line is not only wrong, if you say it enough, you might start to believe it, which is a shame, because if you really want to see innovating in gaming, you are missing out on some real gems by completely disregarding the other systems.","c04kn0d":"Haha the idea that the Wii is better is laughable. I got my PS3 for 400 with a 100 gift card, so really it is only 50 dollars cheaper. Then you add in the fact that it has no hard drive and piss poor graphics compared to the xbox or ps3 and it doesn't have any media support either(dvd or blu ray). \n\nI don't think you will ever be able to convince me that having the ability to wave my hands around when I play makes the gaming experience better.","c04krai":"True...

Every multiplatform game looks exactly the same on the 360 as on the PS3, Unless they just don't compress anything there is really no reason to use 50 gigs.  In practice the 360 has better games than the PS3. And I don't care about blu-ray because I don't watch dvds, and they haven't proven themselves useful for games.  Intuitive gameplay through better programming makes a game better, not massively insane amounts of unnecessary information. Also Blu ray is slow as fuck.  Whoever said more game data is better?  MGS has vastly more amounts of \"game data\" than any other game produced and yet it isn't nearly the greatest game ever.\n\n\nI've played wii's version of network gaming through super smash bros,  I found it unwieldy and more hassle than its worth.  I played network gaming on PS2 and found that to be hard to use also.  \n\nThe reason I much prefer xbox's is because of the friends list, the common guide that runs seperate from the game so I know what games my friends are playing, exactly what they are doing in that game, join up with them, if possible, send them messages, private chat, and send them screenshots and videos from my game.  Sure you can get some of those features with the ps3, but it's also a playstation 3, which has, in my opinion, crappy games and a shitty controller. From my perspective PSN users are not paying anything because if they were charged than nobody would play it, because vast majority of networked console games are on the 360.   Also, enjoy having a controller that doesn't rumble. \n\n","c04z57h":"I was specifically talking about the guys whining about paying for downloadable content, when I said it is simple business.  They make a product, the downloadable content, like extra songs for rockband, that costs them money to make. There are royalties to the artist, they NEED to charge for it.   PSN has downloadable content also, at the same exact price.  PSN has just much less downloadable content in general.\n\n\nBut if you were talking about networked gaming in general, Not all network gaming is the same, because not every console is the same.  The Playstation 3 has a terrible, rumbleless controller, it has less people playing the online games, and it has much less games.\n\nI got my new, premium 360 for 200 dollars, people have bought the PS3 for 600 dollars.  Xbox live costs 50 dollars a year.  I get to have 8 years of xbox with live before I spend as much as somebody who has Playstation 3 with PSN. The consoles will be obsolete by then, following the 5 year rule. So who got the better deal?  You completely disregard upfront price.  Ever think that maybe all the playstation 3 owners think they have a better product because they spent three times as much as me? \n\nThis phenomena is known as \"denial and rationalization\"\n","c04z5ud":"Ha.

The rest of us, either went with over-the-top-pc-games ( Half-Life \/ Far Cry \/ WoW \/ etc. ) or the more arcade types just played some flash games.\n\nWii is the first console we bought since we were kids because the controller adds something to the experience and its better suitable to living=room=multiplayer. \n\nAs to Micosoft .. the rest of market will NEVER buy something called a fucking XBox.

(more towards Adult's which is a smart move). \n\nThe real game-changer would be apple though. Now, gaming like devices become import and are starting to melt with media-center like software, competitors may come from another side as well now. We can see this happening with the iPhone _right now_. \n\nImportant for these kind of machines is brand trust. My gameboy _still works_. That's the kind of hardware Ninento sells. Everybody that is buying one of those Wii's trusts\/knowns that the interface is simple and too the point. MS will never get that trust. Sony neither.

In fact the only thing ported to the Wii was the NAME and some of the MAPS.\n\n&gt;Oblivion, Call of duty 4, and GTA 4 were all multiplatform and all look better than resistance fall of man, on the ps3. And that is just a single case.\n\nThat's pretty subjective. We'll have to take your word for it. The word on the streets is that PS3 is more capable, but the 360 got the better graphics card. Which makes it easier for developers to get great graphics from the 360.\n\nThat there is an interesting metric; developers' effort. PS3 should _eventually_ outshine the XBox, but as of to day there are no PS3 limited engines on the market that do so.\n\n&gt;Would you stop making up stuff that clearly is not true.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.videogamer.com\/news\/28-07-2008-8928.html\n\n&gt;You are a fanboy because you are fanatically devoted to your wii\n\nI think the Wii present the best console for somebody like me, but I didn't claim it was techinically superior. Fuck, i'm a developer myself, not in the games-field although I did make my own crappy 3d engine once. The Wii is less superior in a lot of metrics, except for the what-i-care-about-metric.\n\nWhat I was explaining above by the way had little to do with the Wii fanboyism. \n\nI'm just stating the obvious. When you write a game with the intention of supporting multiple platforms, you take the lowest common denominator. So, perhaps you upscale the textures on the stronger devices. But for example, things like the size of the BSP tree inbetween loading segments are just one small example of a choice that is going to be made with the lowest common denominator.\n\n&gt;based purely on the fact that theres more room for better textures and higher quality\n\nSounds like you are pretty clueless here. Storage is not the bottleneck. It could be; but here is the fun part.\n\nPart of the Microsoft liscence rules for XBox games is that if you support more consoles, besides the XBox, they should not have more content than on the XBox. \n\nIn case you were wondering, yes that legal and yes that pretty normal in the console industry. They can pretty much make up any conditions they want.\n\nIn the past, Nintento didn't allow for blood on its consoles (NES and SNES) whereas Sega did.. \n\nSo, although a PS3 is technically superior to a XBox 360, you are going to notice little of that. And if you think you do (are you hand-counting polygons or something? LOL) you are fooling yourself.\n\n**Why XBox360 versions of multi-platform games likely look better than PS3 version**\n\nWith multi-platform games, from a techinical point of view, I expect the 360 games to look better. When you develop a game for more than one console, you still want _one_ _code_ _base_. Hence the PC, the 360 version and PS3 versions are just compilation options (target architectures). This has the following consequences:\n\n- The PS3 provides more MIPS on the CPU level, which could be used for physics and AI. But to take advantage of all that power, you need to write a much much much more concurrent program. You either need to write a lot of PS3 only program code -or- use higher level programming language where concurrency is easier, yet such a thing is not quite industry-standard (they tend to work with C\/C++ for the hardcore engine stuff). \n\n- But when it comes to graphical capabilities, the graphics card in the 360 is superior.It will give you higher frame-rates and allow for higher qualitiy textures. All you have to do is ship with higher quality data. You don't have to change a single line of code. \n\n&gt;You are a fanboy because you are fanatically devoted to your wii, without even considering any other console. I have 2 of them and have played all three quite a bit.\n\nYes, I love my Wii. Yes, I hate Microsoft (because they are destroying my line of work and are holding the IT industry back IMHO).\n\nBut that doesn't mean i'm full of shit. Actually, you claiming you 'notice' differences between the XBox 360 versions of games and the PS3 versions, that is talking up your ASS.\n\nAs to Wii ports: in those cases the Wii port wasn't a port at all.\n\nMore like: \n\"oh shit, everybody bought a Wii\"\n\"we need to port to the Wii\"\n\"oh shit, our engine is too advanced for the Wii\"\n\"lets take the old PS2 generation engine, cut down on the complexity of the maps and just dump the game unfinished, riddled with bugs and bad controls\"\n\nThat's how they port games to the Wii.\n\nNow, does that sound like a Wii fanboy to you?\n\nI still love my Wii and little use for an XBox (the Wii controls or the mouse\/keyboard combo are the only acceptable controls for me anyway).\n\nI did buy an XBox (not the 360 though) .. but not for games. We used them as linux servers ;-) They were just very very cheap .. no suprise there; Micosoft is making a loss on them.

A lot of people claim that it needs to be charged because of all the services they add to it.  That's a load of BS.\n\nMost of the online gaming is peer-to-peer and not server-client.  Your online stats are stored on their servers, but the actual gameplay takes place peer-to-peer.\n\nWhat MS and their fanboys are arguing is that the additional perks of the live service make it worth the money.  If that were the case, MS could simply put online gaming on the silver membership and all the \"extras\" on the gold membership.  This would never happen as most people just get it to play online with their friends, the perks are just a bonus but not something worth the money.\n\nMS had a big headstart with their console.  This resulted in a large lead in console penetration in homes.  Since they had the largest install base and they were the first to have an non-pc online service, they could charge for it basically because of its novelty (and most console gamers have really low expectations - if they came from PC, they would have seen the live fee as sacrilege).  When a good online game comes out for both ps3 and xbox, people generally buy the xbox version.  Why?  \n\nis it\n\na) Because most of their friends have an xbox and they want to play online.\n\nb) the xbox gold perks\n\n\nYou know the answer is a.  People get the xbox version because most of their friends have it and they want to play together.  They're willing to continue to eat the LIVE fee because there's no alternative - their friends don't have ps3s.  \n\nAfter they've already paid for it, they need to convince themselves that it was a worthy investment by bringing up all the great things that gold membership offers in addition to just online play.\n\nPC gamers often use STEAM as an example of a good online service with plenty of profiling information, achievements, etc, yet still remaining free.  \n\nWhile all companies are out to make money, companies to MS are CLEARLY just out to make money whereas companies like Valve at least put soul into their products and respect their consumers.\n","c0539kn":"That's cause there's more casual gamers that don't have a crapload of money to spend on a more high end hardcore gamer centric system like the ps3 and 360. You *cannot* lump the Wii into the mix, while its appeal does cross over into the pool of people that you'd consider \"real\" gamers, it by no means implies that those types of people are shunning the ps and 360 for the wii. Wii does in fact have a horrible lineup of games for the average gamer, but the majority of its owners don't know or care because they're not really gamers like we know.","c053l6z":"&gt;fun\n\nAll of the games you mention could be fun. If you do not find them fun, by all means, do not spend your money on them. GTA4? I found it fun. Bioshock? I found it fun. Oblivion? Also. Supreme commander? OK, I can totally see where you're coming from on that one.\n\n&gt;It's all become boring, unoriginal concepts.\n\nTo be fair, there are not that many concepts video game designers can actually toy with that will sell. Do you mean in terms of approach, style, flavour and story? Or do you mean in terms of genre?\n\n&gt;or new attempts at gameplay mechanics.\n\nThere are plenty. You're either just not looking for them, or you're overlooking them.\n\n&gt;Where are the times when I had to guide a travel agent through the land of the dead in search of his love, or when my inept pirate wannabe had to learn the best rhyming insults to win his swordfights?\n\nKilled dead by the legions of casual fucktards who now comprise the video gaming public. People who never even had a megadrive, let alone an amiga or an atari. Heck, there's kids these days who never even had an original playstation. Blame the newcomers, because honestly, it IS THEIR FAULT. Haha.\n\n&gt;How long has it been since I've launched a volley of torpedoes at the shield generator of an Imperial Star Destroyer? \n\nDepends. Do you have Battlefront 2?\n\n&gt;Today it's either generic FPS, generic RTS clickfest or generic dumbed down action-RPG.\n\nNaw, man, there's some gems out there, to be sure.

I'm very comfortable with hdloader as well.","c053oq1":"All big online communities costm especially if they are 3D. This is why so many MMORPG games charge monthly fees and the others allow you to buy eqipment. The server costs involved in building and maintaining a 3D fully online unlimited amount of people multiplayer social network is mindboggling. Sony aren't MS, and I doubt they can just eat up the debt with the success of windows like MS do, because they don't make an OS and are much, much smaller than MS. They make something like 60% of their total profit on the playstations, so they cannot afford to handle all the costs themselves. They could start charging for home items and equipment though, but I don't know if that is better or worse.","c053qm5":"I do not think that they will ever change the spec for the ps3 memory, all that would do would alienate people, or cause glitches and bugs.

A sort of 3d-platform meets wii tennis, meets wii fit..\n\nThe funny thing is .. a lot of games could be like that, if only they made the controls work like they should. But somehow a lot of companies are stuck in their translate-motion-into-button-press. Hence all the waggling.\n\nI gues you can invent a new controller and all, but balancing controls, gameplay and story is something only few people are capable of doing. The rest of the industry just follows.\n\nRemember back in the days where they were figuring out the controls for 3d FPS on the PC? Remember the transition from keyboard to keyboard &amp; mouse? There were a lot of failed games in between... that just didn't get it right. That whole WASD meme comes from this era as well.\n\nNow, think about the transition of 3d FPS to controllers. It was Goldeneye for the N64 that got it right. That control setup is still used for all the new ps3 and xbox 360 games...\n\nPoint is, with new controls the developers need to reinvent the game genre's and control schematics .. This also involves gameplay a lot; jumping and timing puzzles are a lot of fun when you are only pressing buttons, but when you introduce some analog axis .. gameplay involving reflexes and aiming start being more fun. \n\nIt no wonder we are seeing so many horror games for the Wii in 2009. Reflex- and aim- based gameplay fit the horror genre nicely and there are some proven control setups that work (see also RE4) ..\n\nI also believe that after Metroid Prime 3, we will see that, control-wise, the Wii works best for FPS. Esspecially when you add some environmental interaction.. \n\nWhat they need to figure out though is that when possible the Wiimote should be used to control the camera .. until you hold a button to enter aim\/shoot\/hit mode .. \n\nThe point is, until somebody does it right and shows the rest of the industry how it's done, we are going to see a lot of games with less than pleasant controls. It gets worse when the games are ports and weren't designed with those controls in mind in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","c05dyap":"The login worked with my psn credentials, which makes me think it's legit.

Sex education is a type of education (even if some people in public office don't think it should be).\n\nIsn't sex education mandatory and obvious. I'm from Europe, so this might be a difference; but are there any americans that don't understand the relationship between intercourse and pregnancy?\n\n&gt;Abortions and birth control pills are also expensive\n\nThey are free here; but compared to housing and food really not that expensive; and if you have  to have sex; a smart investement.\n\n&gt;If you're just barely making ends meet, of course you're going to spend all you have!\n\nYet, the 'middleclass' and 'rich' people also spent all their money. What I'm trying to say here is that people automatically live at the luxury level that 'just barely' fits their income.\n\nIt doesn't matter where you look. If your income is xxx, you are going to spent xxx. Which is weird; somehow you need whatever you can afford.\n\n&gt;These aren't the folks who are stuck in a rut; they're the ones who DO go on family vacations and all that jazz.\n\nSo when we refer to poor people we are referring to people who do not own tv's or mobile phones or a modern pc capable of playing say video games. \n\nIf that is how you measure, there are very very very few poor people in Europe. Except for the drug addicts and the homeless. (whenever those definitions do not overlap). I doubt it would be much different in the USA.\n\n&gt;Unhealthy processed food (ramen noodles, canned soup, macaroni and cheese, etc.) is less expensive than \"health food\" and fresh produce.

It's the meat and fish that's expensive. (that is: i only eat cow and fish and only unproccesed .. no hamburgers and crap like that)\n\nUnhealthy food maybe unhealthy; it doesn't make you fat until you eat too much of it. Which inevitable should be more expensive than not eating it.\n\nCanned soup, macaroni, etc. doesn't have any vitamins. You could eat like a fucking whale from that crap and still don't get any vitamins.\n\nBut that doesn't explain why all these people are fat. You don't get less fat by eating healthy food. You need 1500 kc a day. So, that is one sausage on a stick. You eat one sausage on a stick. You do not eat the whole box, just because it costs as much as one healthy meal. \n\nIt's just another excuse. I'll repeat: you can be unhealthy and poor, but you don't need to be fat and poor. \n\nYes, it would still be unhealthy. But that doesn't change the fact that people that are fat, do not need to change _what_ they eat, just _how much_ of it they eat. \n\nMy point here was there, when it comes to addictions,the money's always there. Cigarettes, alcohol, fat. The iPod, the playstation. None of these things are good value propositions.

It sounds absurd to you why that is, but the sixaxxis\/dual shock \"top\" buttons are designed very differently than the 360 ones. But more importantly, its done that way, because it makes sense and feels more natural.\n\nInfinity Ward and EA knew this when they released COD4 and Bad company respectively on the PS3.

I mean, as soon as the Wii came out, many star wars fans thought that it'd be perfect for 1:1 lightsaber battles.\n\nStepping back even further - what is going on with the lousy controls? I know that games can play a heck of a lot better with the motion controls (see Soul Calibur: Legends or Trauma Center) but why are developers dropping the ball on this? I mean, the point is to make money, right? When the Wii's selling point is *the controls*, why cripple them before the game even hits the shelves?\n\nI'm saying this not as a 360\/ps3 fanboy but as a frustrated Wii owner. The only two games I'm looking forward to at this point are Tatsunoko vs. Capcom (which may not even get brought over to the US) and Madworld, the latter which has gone back to 'revamp the controls'.","c05rkvj":"&gt;I don't know why having an open router seems to be the default behavior in your mind.\r\n\r\nThe comparison with wifi sharing is used because people also share the internet *within their own homes*, to the second computer, or laptop, or xbox\/playstation.","c05rlbk":"I'm a virtua tennis \/ top spin junkie so my opinion of Wii Tennis is pretty low, but that's not specific to the Wii.

If I'm not mistaken, you can still play the original Diablo on Battle.net, which is ad-supported.\n\nFinally, there are no details as to where the ads will be shown. Multiplayer lobby rooms? Loading screens? In the game? You can't jump to conclusions this early; besides, they'll probably look at specific games and advertise accordingly.

It's a fake challenge.\n\nIt comes from the button-mentality. The point of combo's is not that there aren't enough buttons: it's that it should be HARD TO DO CERTAIN MOVES, because pressing a button is TOO EASY.\n\nThey could even in a lot of cases, where a move is context dependent, just do the context-dependent move.\n\nCombo's are just last generation (controller-wise) mini-game.\n\nThey could have made all the 'different' moves easy to pull off. They chose to intentionally make it difficult, because THAT is the only way to make a game more difficult that they can imagine.\n\nOn the PC, a FPS can scale out to precision aiming to make it more challenging. On a console, they tend to just go with platform elements and combo's. \n\nThings are changing a little bit on the next generations: the wii has better controls (if you make a proper game for it), the ps3 has enough horse power to really do AI.

(but i'm not here to discuss their evil market plays or the short term profit thinking fucktards that make the historic mistake of ever buying any of their products, without seeing the big picture)\n\nIt's just such a boring default that most gamers won't even realize that ALL GAMES ARE THE SAME. Almost all anyway. Press buttons, in right order at the right time. You could literally just remember the order and timing of a complete game and just turn off the TV. Sure, they throw in some other mini games: little puzzles, perhaps a little strategy .. if you lucky even a descent story and beautifull world. But the gameplay is still mario-bros with a gun. Jump, shoot .. press button . .. control puppet .. press button .. \n\nIt's all memory\/timing game-play.\n\nPerhaps it's a generational thing, but there are millions of types of gameplay possible if you have something mouse\/wii-mote like. (let's call it pointer-controls). The challenge could for example be in the aiming precision. \n\nRace wheels .. is another fine example. Race games on consoles are not race games. It's not even remotely the same. But these kids nowadays, they have never seen arcade .. .. \n\nThey can't possible imagine a world where console games would not be press-button-combo's and time it well with bling, story and mini-games.\n\n","c05s3yq":"I've found several bugs.

But the actual lyrics don't seem to be the issue. Muslims (that is, *some* Muslims, who also happen to be assholes) are offended by any combination of the Koran and music.

Of course, if this prick hadn't snagged a copy before release, the delay never would have happened.

Also, if Sony were to ban your ps3 from new account creation, you could always argue that you just bought it from a friend and demand that they allow you to create and account.","c05x4n7":"The price is a major factor here.  The cheapest ps3 is $200 more expensive than the cheapest 360, largely due to Sony's insistence on bundling their consoles with Blu-ray capabilities as if it were a Trojan Horse (which sort of worked save for the fact that few consumers give a rat's ass about HD in general).\n\nIt's sort of sad because as a 360\/ps3 owner I find that my time is split equally between them and that Sony's PSN games are getting better and better (Everyday Shooter, Pixeljunk Monsters, Pixeljunk Eden, The Last Guy, Wipeout HD, etc.) and there are some great titles on the horizon.","c05x6ti":"I don't know if it's TBS thing or a comcast specific thing.\nThread: http:\/\/community.comcast.net\/comcastportal\/board\/message?board.id=MLB&amp;thread.id=37073\n\n[Edit]: More info from MLB.com, it's everyone:\nhttp:\/\/mlb.mlb.com\/news\/article.jsp?ymd=20081018&amp;content_id=3629863&amp;vkey=ps2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb\n\n","c05x9a4":"I find that streaming high definition videos from a pc to the ps3 does not work well in wireless mode.

Just about every router I used would give me completely unacceptable results on the ps3.  \n\nA firmware upgrade on the ps3 using either a linksys or d-link router would require about 45-50 minutes to download.  Changing the firmware to ddwrt on my linksys (no longer use the d-link) without any movement of the ps3 or router reduced the time for downloading the upgrade file down to 1-2 minutes (not by 1-2 minutes, down to). \n\nBefore you ask, I tried a number of times downloading videos and other files and they show about the same 50x improvement.  Firmware upgrades are all around the same size so it makes the most sense to give times for that.\n\nHope this helps, I wanted to put my ps3 in a location where the ethernet cable didn't quite reach but was unable to get wifi working, so it had to be exposed more than I wanted.  It annoyed me to death, but when I found ddwrt... wow.  The improvement wasn't slight and heck, now that router works better for my laptop as well.\n\n\n","c05xu23":"Only an honourable mention for Wipeout? GTFO.\n\n[edit]\n\nI'll justify that a little.

Not bad considering they released their console a year later.  \n\nSource: http:\/\/www.joystiq.com\/2008\/10\/29\/worldwide-ps3-sales-beat-xbox-360-in-q2\/","c063gyj":"sony? you mean the guys who evolutioned the portable music player market with the walkman and then revolutioned the console market with the playstation series knocking off once king nintendo, sega and what not...\n\n","c063idm":"Actually, HD DVD was ahead, and its release forced Sony to push BR out way before they were ready.  That is what caused the confusion about standards.

That is pathetic, i've played a lot of those games and they are good i'll give you that, but to someone who wants to play games (especially top notch 3rd party games) a 360 is the only way to go. As an avid gamer I need no blueray player with my console. In fact all I see that as is just another reason for sony to charge more. Price wise: 360, Game Selection Wise: 360. Online Service: 360.

And I forgot to add $50\/yr for online play, which puts it way over.\n\n&gt;O and ninja gaiden, gtaIV, Mirror's Edge, dark sector, and dead space are all also for the 360. \n\nI play them on my PS3, you play them on your 360. We can play both. There isn't a law that says you are only allowed to play \"exclusives.\" If that was the case, then you aren't allowed to play Gears or Mass Effect because they came out for PC. MGS, Heavenly Sword, Uncharted, Resistance 2, Wipeout HD, Siren and LBP are never coming for PC or any system but PS3. You can't say the same for the 360 \"exclusives.\" It would have made no sense for me to get a 360 when I already had a gaming PC.\n\n&gt;As an avid gamer I need no blueray player with my console.\n\nAs an avid gamer and movie fan I need a bluray player and pretty soon even casual fans with HDTV's will want it. If HD movies weren't a concern Microsoft would have never made the HD-DVD drive for 360.\n\n&gt;That is pathetic, i've played a lot of those games and they are good i'll give you that\n\nYou said the games were good and pathetic in the same sentence, wtf man? The only 360 games I've wanted to play have come to PC and\/or PS3, aside from Ninja Gaiden 2 (and I bought that for my brother's 360).\n\nMore importantly than that, there are a sick amount of games to play for PS3 right now. I'm jumping between Dead Space and LBP at the moment (I've got Far Cry 2 and Fallout 3 on the PC where they belongs). Resistance 2 is out next week, with COD5 coming up after, then Mirror's Edge, POP. To say their aren't games on PS3 is to say you've gotten too caught up in this \"exclusive\" mess. \n\nBut if you want to make this conversation just about exclusives, then it's Gears 2 and Fable 2 vs LBP and Resistance 2, and I'm pretty sure there are people who prefer the PS3 side of that (myself definitely included).","c063l7b":"So this guy's bitching that Blu-ray has copy-protection measure...doesn't he realize how easily we've gotten around that with DVD?

For example during the fall I would pray to god like this \"Please make a leaf fall on my head if x girl is attracted to me\" or \"Please make it rain today if x girl secretly wants to have sex with me\". Sadly no leafs fell, and no rain came. God either didn't exist or x girl(s) did not want to be my friend\/girlfriend.

If it's a slight drop, that's hardly a surprise. In November 2007, the PSP was still riding high on the launch of the 2000 model, which incredibly enough actually surged it over the DS in sales for a while -- even in Japan.\n\nI won't comment on upcoming software, since handheld games for the most part bore me to tears. But if you say there's stuff to look forward to, I'll take your word for it.\n\nAs for the iPhone, I don't think so. The iPhone isn't even close to a serious gaming platform at this point. It has next to no support from \"real\" developers, and what it does get are third-rate ports of titles on other systems. As Sony has learned to a lesser extent, you can't toss on gaming capabilities as an afterthought.  They need to be the focus, and one of the things that requires is, believe it or not, buttons!

If the 360 has this ability I've yet to figure it out. That and the ability to slap in any laptop sized hard drive into the PS3 with a few simple steps over having to get those proprietary hd+enclosures of the 360 means i'd have to give expandability to the PS3.\n\nAlso, you can install Linux on the PS3 and dual boot between game mode and computer mode without voiding your warranty or hacking the system though I myself haven't tried this. \n\nAlso, the PS3 is compatible with just about any bluetooth device where as, and i'm not 100% on this, I think the Xbox only works with licensed peripherals.\n\nSo again, personally, i'd go with the PS3 but the 360 does have it's advantages and hopefully something i've said will help you pick the one that's right for you.\n\nOh, one last thing. I like the PS3's store better then the 360's if for no other reason then the PS3 uses actual money instead of 'points' that you have to buy first.\n\nJust noticed i forgot one last, though important point, built in Blu-ray drive ( and considered the most future proof of the blu-ray players ) make the PS3 a must if you're a hi-def movie nut.\nUpscales DVD's a treat too.","c06o2mv":"way more quality games on the megadrive\/genesis than on the ps3","c06o3tv":"There you are!

As it starts, in the chess area the three tables are full and everyone else is just standing around, i guess waiting for their turn to play.

And here's another thought, maybe I already had an HDTV, because it's not specific to the console, maybe I watch *ghasp* TV shows on it.\r\n\r\nNow, to the point about controls. Who cares? If everybody uses the same controls, what difference does it make that mouse\/kb is better in fps games? What about platformer games like God of War, or Prince of Persia, or driving sims like gt, or fighting games like Soulcalibur where the controller is far better.\r\n\r\nJust because you only play one type of game, doesn't mean your control scheme is the best in town.\r\n\r\nAnd what about the social aspect, I have friends over we sit on a couch play some soulcalibur. PC, not so good for that. \r\n\r\nAnd then we always have a FUD argument about graphics. Well, here's some news for you, you NEED the higher graphics on the pc. You know why?

And you get the big screen experience to boot, quite cinematic.\r\n\r\nHere's the other thing people don't realize, because console is well a console, it's locked specs. So developers are able to optimize for those specs and the games constantly improve visually throughout the life of the console, and cost to me as the customer, nothing. That's right I don't have to go out and buy a new video card every time a new generation game comes out.\r\n\r\nAnd consoles dying? seriously? well, maybe if you were a sucker and bought a 360, for PS3 and WII, well turns out it's pretty low.\r\n\r\n\u201cFailure rates for all other consoles were not high enough for EB to consider revising their policies.

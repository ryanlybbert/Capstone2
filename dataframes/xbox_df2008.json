patented DRM was the option they chose.\n\nNow certain movies only come out on HD-DVD, only play on xbox's or Windows PC's, or worse yet, only Windows **MEDIA CENTERS**, the studios are happy because they silence critics, and have online sales of digital movies at $12, as much as physical media.\n\nMicrosoft now can say linux isn't even compatible with the drives that play this media, or the motherboards that support the DRM (or CPUs).\n\nLinux advocates will stand firm, as they should, and look at more independent studios who release in open formats. \n\nHowever, the decision to limit games and movies to windows machines, if you want to use your new HD technology, forces families to upgrade to the latest, surging a new raise in MSFT stock.\n\nMicrosoft isn't being forced to do anything you daft fuck. They are in cahoots. Look how hardware makers, microsoft and studios are all in it with HD DVD? look how they even got the FCC in it with the fucking broadcast flag.\n\nYou are a fucking knobhead.\n\nGet a fucking clue, life and a box so  you can at least try and think outside of it.\n\n**bottom line** : Microsoft want to lure studios into their patented DRM, license fees per media, drive and system, their distribution network. Microsoft already did this with DirectX, and look, **you cannot LEGALLY play a studio DVD on linux. You. Absolutely. Cannot.** Do you think this will change with the next release of games, moves and downloadable content?\n\nMicrosoft have more people in Washington than the gun people, farmers, oil people, power people and feminists and gays together!","c02tk5o":"I don't know, the free brand new xbox they gave us two days after our other one broke down sure did a lot to buy back our devotion...","c02tlng":"Nope, only for Xbox live members.

I dug through their account management web page and was instructed to change my subscription options through the console. On the console I was told to change my subscription through the webpage.\n\nThe 360 doesn't have a web browser, and a web browser doesn't have access to the native xbox live controls.  It seems that controlling subscription options in one of two places seems broken.  What happens if people don't have a computer, or they have the red ring of death on their 360 and can't get to their payment options?\n\nAt the end of it all I couldn't find the subscription options, so I canceled the credit card it was attached to.  My bank has a much better interface than xbox live, or the live website.\n\nAfter this I found out that recurring subscriptions have a grace period of a few months after credit card cancellations and expirations.

All of the application servers ran in user space, and yet it still managed to have performance, as other people have mentioned, that runs circles around modern operating systems.  What's the advantage?  Those application severs handled everything from the filesystem and graphics to 3D game libraries and multimedia processing.  The upshot:  BeOS was optimized for doing multimedia processing, so it was possible to get nanosecond latency in real time audio processing utilities like real time effects processing.  This is still impossible in windows, and I don't know whether it's possible in OS X, but it was still a crazily succesful design that I think  is worth studying.\n2) It had a beautiful standard library.  Because it was a C++ Object Oriented project from the get go, you had access to a full library for everything from low level os stuff to high level graphics\/media\/etc, that was all highly optimized and very feature rich.  For example, you could write an audio processing utility which took a standard 'input' and 'output', and then hook your utility into any other sound utility running on the OS, regardless of who wrote it.  So you could chain multimedia programs together the way you chain your xbox into your vcr into your tv (or guitar effects for any musicians out there).  But think about it, a hugely plug and play software environment!! Nothing like that exists today (within a given application yes, but not on the level of an entire OS).  When people talk about the BeOS they usually talk about the end use experience and how snappy it was (it really f*ing was, their example which ran on a 200mhz machine had 9 windows each of which had a rotating opengl cube with videos playing on each surface, i'll bet you coulnd't do that today on vista) but I think the most beautiful part of the OS was it's awesome design and standard library.

Almost all those chemicals are INSIDE THE BATTERY AND POWER ADAPTER.  When you repair a system, you DON'T OPEN THEM.  I don't think MS went out of their way to wipe the kid's xbox clean.

What likely happened is that the repair tech diagnosed the problem and then set it aside while waiting for parts or maybe sent it to someone else that just fixes xboxes with that particular problem all day. The note got lost.  What the guy should have done is bought a new xbox and put the case on it himself. Since it was out of warranty, it would probably not have been much more expensive.","c03bhvu":"So no followup on the comments that this was a prank by his parents because they found him snooping through presents the night before, and he really got an xbox later that day?

Forget that. I'd rather buy more drives.","c03ci7n":"Fair enough, but none of this indicates that Microsoft will continue this trend of having literally 95% market share in every market they enter.\n\nThey have a lot of advantages for sure. I'm more of a wii-type gamer myself, but it seems like with the gaming industry Microsoft has a foothold in software, development and online capabilities that don't come as naturally to their Japanese competitors. On the other hand, I've read that xbox games run more or less like PC games, but that the playstation 3 cell architecture will be extremely powerful once developers get a grip on it and start making use of it. PS3 bombed out the gate and the games were mostly ports that played the same on the xbox 360, but the PS3 is getting cheaper all the time, and developers and consumers could easily start to grow into the new technology as they are with blu-ray.\n\nBut all these good and bad points aside, they're just a company now. Last year, when I said Apple was on the move Microsoft fans just laughed it off, but at the rate things are going they need to stop laughing.

I want to offer to help explain the situation to the parties involved (the Ms. Jones, Parent or Police officer) about the many failures in your story.\r\n \r\nThe failures include, but are not limited to the following;\r\n \r\n* Halo 3 has no video capability.  Halo 3 has nothing to do with your story.\r\n* Video Games and Video Game Systems (or Video Game Consoles) are not interchangeable terms.\r\n* Video Games are not \"a haven for children\" but are a mainstream entertainment enjoyed by all ages.\r\n* The Children were not randomly subjected to nudity, they accepted to view the video.\r\n* The parent called, Xbox LIVE who said \"I cant do anything about it\". Why is that?  Based on her story \"I quickly turned off the console\" I would guess is that she didn't know *who* she wished to report.\r\n* Xbox LIVE has the most robust player review system in the marketplace.  It has Parental controls and Player Ranking methods unmatched in the industry.  These methods allow you to block people, they also alllow you to report EXACTLY this behaviour directly from the machine. It is the \"File Complaint\" method.  The Parent in the story doesn't understand that 18004myxbox (the customer service line) would not be able to tell her who had communicated with her children (for technical and privacy reasons for both parties), the system is designed to VERY easily report this behaviour.\r\n* Xbox LIVE is divided into Zones.  The Zones are constructed to divide different groups, they are Recreational, Family, Pro, and Underground.  Parents should confirm their children are in the Family Zone.\r\n \r\nI would be happy to correspond with your staff to help you prepare a follow-up story that will correct the misrepresentations in your original article.\r\n \r\nAll of the current generation of Video Game Systems (Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360) have online components (Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, PlayStation Network (PSN) and Xbox LIVE respectively).  Each have equal \"opportunity\" for these kinds of negative activities.  What is most saddening is that the Xbox 360 Video Game System and the online-service (Xbox LIVE) has the most robust methods for Parents and Game Players to prevent and avoid these negative activities.\r\n \r\nPerhaps you could do another story discussing how to avoid these negative activities -- starting with the Golden Rule \"Dont Talk To Strangers\" -- from the perspective of modern Video Game Systems and Online Services.\r\n \r\nAt the very least, you should take responsibility for your inaccurate reporting and inform your audience of your errors.\r\n \r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nYou can contact WLNS here;\r\n\r\nThe reporter was Katherine Jones, her email is kjones@wlns.com\r\nThe news direcotr is Philip Hendrix, his email is phendrix@wlns.com or newsdirector@wlns.com \r\n\r\n6 News \r\n2820 East Saginaw Street \r\nLansing, MI 48912 \r\n\r\nMain Phone: (517) 372-8282 \r\nNews Phone: (517) 372-1300 \r\n\r\nCall and ask for Katherine Jones or the News Director to correct the story.\r\n","c03e4f7":"Ha ...

The PS3 has also gotten a few good exclusives lately (Ratchet and Clank, Folklore) to keep up.  BluRay and DVD upscaling, plus being able to stream media from my linux box all make the PS3 the number one console in my house.  The xbox 360 comes in a close second right now because of Lost Odyssey, the video marketplace, and a superior selection of content on xbox live arcade compared to the playstation network.  If the Playstation Network had tv shows and movies available for download, and a better selection of games, I would probably barely touch the 360.","c03iy8f":"&gt;*gaming reddit is already kind of small.*\r\n\r\nGaming is pretty big with 7345 subscribers, so I think it can spare a few. \r\n\r\nI imagine people other than myself would also like to filter just xbox360 news to our brains than have to sift through all the crap about the Wii\/PS3\/PC...","c03iyzz":"FYI, any version of the PS3 plays the old games, except the late models do it all in software emulation, exactly how the PPC 360 is back-compatible with the x86 xbox original.

It's mostly from high scores on xbox and being a child.","c03jiao":"PS3 has a lot more exclusives on his own list.  Every xbox360 game has a PS3 entry, except 2.  Halo and Fable.  Both Halo and Fable are garbage.\n\nBTW, I own 2 xbox360's...(don't ask why).  I have like 6-10 games for it.  I have played only 2 game on it that I actually enjoyed.  Gears of War was crap.  Halo was crap.  All Tom Clancy games were crap except Rainbow Six, which I do like very much (which exists for PS3).  I enjoyed Mass Effect, but was underwhelmed by very poor attention to detail and clunkiness.\n\nxbox360 is a huge disappointment in many ways.  It has few good games and it has a high failure rate.  For sure PS3 lacked games on launch and even today good PS3 games are thin on the ground.  But PS3 has no failures to speak of and the games are improving at a steady clip.  PS3's exclusives are real gems, like Metal Gear Solid.  Metal Gear has such awesome attention to detail.  It is a long game with tons of replay value.  It's a masterpiece.  xbox360 has no masterpieces on it.  Just shitty shooters that are not as good as shooters on the PC.","c03jj9m":"take that back, what a pile of shit. wii only has low resolution.  Even the original xbox in 1999 had 1080i.","c03jjpf":"You don't think it's disappointing that the wii is less powerful than an xbox 1?","c03jk3s":"The viscous sphere is cool but the rest is all HL2-ish. Once again proving the xbox isn't true next gen :(","c03jkuz":"&gt;You don't think it's disappointing the wii is less powerful than an xbox 1?\n\nThat would certainly be disappointing.  Good thing it's not true.  The Wii is certainly not as powerful as the 360 or PS3, but it's actually slightly more powerful than the original Xbox.","c03jllz":"Did anyone else cringe at the Epic Presidents claims about gears of war?\n\n- \"people consider 'Gears' to be the high watermark for technology and video game graphics\"\n\n- \"We've added a lot of new features to the unreal engine and really optimised it for the xbox360\"\n\nThat last one really annoys me.  It's because of that xbox360 love that unreal tournament 3 was such a flop for them, not because PC gaming is dead.","c03jlma":"&gt;Say what you will about Microsoft, but sometimes they get it right, and this is one of those times.\n\nJust wait until an account gets flagged for cheating but managed to set off the detection without actually cheating.\n\n----\n\nNot being able to legitimately earn back the achievements taken from you for cheating seems excessive.  Not all the achievements you've earned were obtained illegitimately and even those that were should be able to be earned back legitimately.  I can understand permanently taking them away if the offender wasn't labeled a cheater, or labeling someone a cheater while leaving the score intact.  Both seems a excessive to me.\n\nI don't think labeling cheaters is going to be at all effective.  Many people on xbox live are douchetards for no reason, live is going to suck for anyone branded as a cheater.  Its just going to force the cheaters to create a new, clean, live account;  I feel bad for those who don't.","c03jna3":"Buy an Xbox 360 for that:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en\/games\/b\/bombermanlivexboxlivearcade\/","c03jnen":"I know this is going to blow a lot of minds, but Poker Smash is the best puzzle game.\r\n\r\nCheck it out:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en\/games\/p\/pokersmashxboxlivearcade\/\r\n\r\nIgnore the fact that it is played with cards, and is related to poker, but the variety of solutions to clear rows is both elegant and simple, but very complex if you want to rack up the score.\r\n\r\nI cannot recommend it enough.","c03jnk0":"&gt;It's because of that xbox360 love that unreal tournament 3 was such a flop for them, not because PC gaming is dead.\n\nUnreal Tournament 3 was made for the PS3, not Xbox 360. What exactly are you trying to argue here?\n\nThe only people to blame for Unreal Tournament 3 not selling well on PC are the PC gamers who didn't buy it. It turned out to be a good, polished game.\n\nAlso, a flop? As of March, it has sold 1 million copies worldwide. The fact that most of those sales were of the PS3 version does not mean that the PC version wasn't good, it just means that PC gamers would rather pirate games than pay for them.","c03jp6z":"I have a PS3 and a 360, and I also commented in the original article saying that, at the moment, my playtime is slightly in favor of the 360.  There were a couple of factors that didn't really get taken into account though in this article that really affect how much play time each console gets for me:\n\nMost of the games that I have for the 360 are bigger in scope than the PS3 games that I have.  Although Devil May Cry 4 (which I own for PS3), Folklore, and Ratchet and Clank are all great games, Lost Odyssey on the 360 is sucking up a lot of my time.  Before Lost Odyssey, a lot of my time on the 360 was playing Oblivion, which is a massive game and a huge timesink.\n\nThe Xbox Live Marketplace is also a huge factor in how often I use the 360.  There are a few really great games on the Xbox Live Arcade that I play whenever I want to sit down and game for 15 or 20 minutes (usually Worms or Metal Slug at the moment).  The PSN offers fewer games, and most of them aren't very appealing.  Plus for some weird reason like 2\/3 of the games on the PSN require the playstation eye.  I'm not sure what's up with that.\n\nAlthough the PS3 gets used for most of my DVD playing now days, the xbox 360 also gets a big chunk of time for the video marketplace.  Since I don't have a DVR or cable tv, I buy shows off the video marketplace if there is something that I really want to keep up with (I bought all of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles off the video marketplace...damn I hope they renew that show for another season)\n\nI buy all multiplatform games on the PS3 both because of the RRoD issue, as well as my personal preference for the PS3 controller over the 360 controller (no flames please, I know a lot of people prefer the 360 controller, I just find it a little bulky and prefer the smaller form factor of the sixaxis)\n\nI'm interested to see what happens with Home, but at the moment I'm approaching it with reserved optimism, because I think there is the definite possibility of it devolving into a prettier secondlife.\n\nAll said and done, I think that the PS3 is the better console, and I like the approach Sony is taking with it, but the maturity of the 360 and the larger amount of content on Live is compelling enough to keep the 360 relevant.  As the PS3 matures over the next year or so, I think sony has the opportunity to bust out and overtake the 360, but they are currently sitting on too much untapped potential.","c03jr1y":"Neither. It was simply an apples to oranges comparison. \n\nI have a Wii (waited in line at the Nintendo store in NYC around christmas time 06) but I also have an xbox and ps2 (planning for a PS3 in the future).\n\nThere's simply no comparing the ps3\/xbox360 to the wii. Nintendo clearly has a market that it caters to and has shied away from it. Only hardcore ps3\/360 owners would be thoroughly concerned about hardware specs - yes, the Wii may be an overclocked Gamecube but does that make any of the games any less fun?\n\nNot really, no.","c03k0d2":"First, thanks for the kind words. It's humbling, particularly given that I feel like I don't make my cases particularly well in general.\n\nWith respect to Tim's new language and the Unreal Technology, I think the closest he's come to making the connection publicly is in [this interview](http:\/\/interviews.teamxbox.com\/xbox\/2169\/Epic-Games-Tim-Sweeney-Interview\/p1\/). In private correspondence, he's said quite a bit more about what he'd like to do, but I don't think (IIRC) he's gone so far as to commit to doing it in Unreal Technology 4, and if the goal is replacing both C++ and UnrealScript, my reading of the tea leaves would be: probably not.\n\nBut short of revealing private correspondence, all I can say is that my understanding is that Tim sees C++'s value (to him) declining rapidly in a multicore world and sees the need to do something about it, where \"doing something about it\" means a multi-year programming language design research and development program. I hope that that will culminate in a new language that's released to the public, as well as being useful for the Unreal Technology.","c03k4lq":"Is Spore coming out for xbox 360?","c03k67u":"ninja gaiden-xbox","c03k890":"erm no he didn't have to parry every hit individually.. apart from the last couple of hits (he jumped). \n\nHe DID have to excecute the parry just BEFORE chun li hit kick to start the super - which is almost as impressive.

what I don't love about ported console games, which is what this guy is singing the praises of:\n\nDiminished support.  Usually, the original devs of the console game are not behind the PC port.  The publisher will typically hire some unknown third party to do the port job, and after the game goes gold, there may be one or two patches to fix the most serious of errors that make the game unplayable.  Maybe.\n\nFor some games, like Metal Gear Solid 2 on PC, the retail copy is completely incompatible with modern video cards, and there is and never will be a patch to fix this.\n\nSure, every now and again we get promising ports of xbox games, but unfortunately those are the exception rather than the rule.","c03kzcw":"I agree with your post except for this point   &gt; every now and again we get promising ports of xbox games\n \nGames ported from that console have been the worst of the lot.  Halo 1&amp;2, Gears of war, and (the yet unreleased on 360) unreal tournament 3.\n","c03l000":"Unreal Engine 3 was developed *ON* a PC but developed *FOR* consoles.  Halo 1 works well now after extensive patching but on it's release (which I bought) it was a buggy, slow, clunky game.  It's only PC improvements that have made it acceptable now.  I guess the same thing will happen with halo 2.\n\nI'm not familiar with KOTOR or fable on PC so I'll take your word for it but certainly in my experience all xbox ports have been awful.\n\n","c03l1dj":"That quote doesnt disagree with me at all, when I said developed *FOR* consoles I didn't mean exclusively or in any technical sense.  I assumed this was obvious due to the fact that gears and unreal even exist for other platforms.\n\nTo be more specific, the engine is geared towards and optimised for consoles.\n\nThe fact that the engine is developed for all those platforms doesn't mean that the playing field is even.\nThere was a topic here on reddit only a few days ago with the CEO of Epic (owner of the unreal engine) saying that the engine was optimised for xbox360.\nhttp:\/\/ninjamonkeys.co.za\/2008\/03\/26\/gears-of-war-2-technology-demo\/\n\n\n\n","c03l348":"Starcraft II, Spore, Left 4 Dead, Fallout 3 (which will be better on PC, just like Oblivion.  Microtransactions?  Pfft.), yet another WoW expansion... and that's just what's coming out in 2008.  So uh... [citation needed]\n\nThe 360, hardware issues aside, is a great platform because of xbox live, and only because of xbox live.  Until Steam can offer the same depth and ease of use with regard to matchmaking as xbl, PC won't be a superior platform for online gaming.\n\nBut it's not like that day will never come.","c03l5lg":"I've been boycotting them since their patch made BF2:MC for the xbox multiplayer unplayable, acknowledged it, then refused to fix it.","c03l6d0":"again, i did, but sorry to say thought it didn't come anywhere near the other FPS available at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf that (was) the best FPS for the xbox, I think that makes me even happier to remain a PC Gamer","c03l7qq":"I was including the cost of a monitor and accessories in that price.  The box by itself would be about $600.  A 360 with a full compliment of accessories costs...  hold on, I'll get a tally on Amazon: \n\nAbout $450 with a year of xbox live gold.  Not bad.  How much does that HD-TV cost again?\n\nAlso, lol on xbox live.  I have steam.  If one of my friends messages me while I'm watching a video, I have the option to turn on voice chat and I can just talk at my monitor because it has a mic built in.  We can then decide on a game to play: one of us joins a server and the other person right clicks on the name and does 'join game' and it works exactly the same way.\n\nThe only thing XBL has up on Steam is that amazing matchmaking service.  It's absolutely fantastic.    ","c03l8ku":"&gt;I was including the cost of a monitor and accessories in that price. The box by itself would be about $600.\n\nA computer without a monitor and \"accessories\" (keyboard \/ mouse) is useless. $600 for the box is a useless figure because that $600 gets you a loud beige box that does nothing in the way of playing video games. Unless you play them with your mind.\n\n&gt; About $450 with a year of xbox live gold. Not bad. How much does that HD-TV cost again?\n\nSo you don't have a TV then right? If you already have a TV and already use it for television it's not part of the cost.\n\n&gt; Also, lol on xbox live. I have steam. If one of my friends messages me while I'm watching a video, I have the option to turn on voice chat and I can just talk at my monitor because it has a mic built in. We can then decide on a game to play: one of us joins a server and the other person right clicks on the name and does 'join game' and it works exactly the same way.\n\nAre all of your games Steam games?\n\n","c03la2a":"Most of the modern concoles support older games from previous formats - the wii can play gamecube games, the 360 xbox games and the ps3 (in certain versions) ps2 and psone games.\r\n\r\nPast games are far more supported by modern hardware than ever before. As for getting stuck in a cycle and abused for money - what exactly have Nvidia been doing for the last five years?\r\n\r\nNvidia: One GFX card not good enough? Buy a motherboard that lets you stick more on! Pay us with your soul or your games will look like shit. *evil laugh*\r\n\r\nA hardware lock in means your purchase doesn't become wasted as quickly and the developers get more time to get the best out of the hardware - thats not a bad thing IMO.","c03la5o":"That game is *fucked up*. I was hung over on a Saturday and got it on my xbox. Next thing I knew it was like 1am. \n\nSomeone wrote a paper on how the color matching games suck you in by giving every small move positive reinforcement. Wish I could find it.","c03lcve":"I finish most games I buy. I still play Call of Duty online and that's the same shit over and over... but for some reason it's addictive and still entertaining. I usually have problems finishing games that are well.. bad, or there are times when 3 good games come out around the same time, and I end up losing interest in one because of the other and then never go back to finish. \n\ni think xbox's gamer achievements system tho really helps put the extra push on this kind of thing tho... adds some incentive. ","c03li1e":"I guess at a large-scale that would be problematic.  But c'mon, all the potential buyers have to deal with is a \"no i am not selling an xbox, sorry.\"  20 seconds wasted including dialing time.  \n\nAnd it's something you can only ethically do to your buddies, and otherwise it's not much fun.  ","c03lp7o":"Long entry, but here's the gist:\r\n\r\n-You cannot delete, edit or remove your credit card info from your Xbox console or xboxlive.com;\r\n\r\n-You can't have it done by email either, you have to jump through Xbox Live's \"phone customer support\" hoops repeatedly;\r\n\r\n-It has to be done by \"engineers\", whatever that means;\r\n\r\n-It takes up to 30 days\r\n\r\n-They have no explanation for why they don't allow you to control your own credit card information after you hand it over to them;","c03lt0d":"I think playing the guitar is fun and relaxing.  My xbox is right next to my amp and guitar and for some reason I always seem to choose the guitar as a boredom buster.\n\nOf course I was playing San Andreas the other night and was going into the gym to buff up my character in game.  As my fingers started getting numb, I looked around and said to myself \"What the hell am I doing?\", got up and walked into the other room to lift some actual weights.\n\nSometimes you need something IRL to get away from all the \"fun\" you're supposed to be having.\n\nC\u2019est la vie","c03lzm8":"New surveys show that pc users spend only 50% of their time on their PCs gaming while they spend 98% of the time on their xboxes gaming.\n\nClearly this survey shows that the PC is a shitty gaming platform.","c03m3rk":"Like I said, \n&gt; I could probably list another ten problems I've found with it\n\nThis hardly comes close to the rage I've had due to bullshit in this game. I actually destroyed a disk by tipping my xbox over when I was so pissed off by a glitch that I stood up, forgetting I was wired and at the end of the wire. Luckily, I pay for the stupid insurance at EB Games for the disks, so I got a new one for free. But man. I can't believe they can get away with selling shit like this. ","c03m5k4":"I hope not.  Martyrdom is probably the worst gameplay mechanic ever, and the multiplayer is crippled without the matchmaking features of xbox live because the gameplay and maps don't adapt well to large scale games like in Battlefield.","c03m5ng":"Scrabble does get pretty competitive. My roomate used to kick my butt, but then he used to be an editor of a paper so he knew every word in the english dictionary. Playing [scrabble online](http:\/\/www.betfromanywhere.com\/blog\/play-for-cash-video-game-tournament-sites-roundup-xbox-playstation-pc-games\/)","c03mgbw":"Yeah man, kids are so nice and they'll just cooperate if you ask.  Oh, that was your xbox 360 I stole?  You want it back?  Here.  You don't have to tell anyone else.\n\nExcept, that's not the case.  We're steps away from having the [Chav](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chav) problem in america, if we don't already.","c03myae":"&gt; No. XBox has lost money. \"Everything else\" certainly does not lose money. If you really believe that, you've got a lot to learn.\n\nWow, your snarky quip must mean I'm wrong.  No need to actually prove what you say.\n\nEDIT: something to chew on:\nhttp:\/\/arstechnica.com\/news.ars\/post\/20070720-office-vista-save-microsoft-profits-from-xbox-ravaging.html","c03n1y8":"I'll be playing MGS4 and xbox owners will still be discussing this rumor. Holy fuck move on already.","c03n5jm":"The simple answer is that finding a proof for the Reimann hypothesis will require a proof of the behavior of prime numbers, no just the old n*n+-1 proof, it would be an actual understanding of prime numbers.  In theory, an understanding of prime numbers to prove the hypothesis could destroy current methods of cryptography.  RSA is considered one of the (if not the) best encryptions around, and it relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of 2 large prime numbers.\nSolving this could mean that current copy protection methods (think xbox, 360, wii, ps3) and current information protection systems would all be compromised.  There is BIG money involved in these protections, and having a method to crack them quickly (say, less than a month with a regular desktop pc) would basically make them worthless.","c03n792":"I think OP meant to type Ho Beast, but obviously it's a typo. I remember back in the day, clustering xboxs and Ho Beasts was the shizzle... ahhhhhhhh","c03n7so":"um...are you kidding?  Did you play Ninja Gaiden on xbox?  It kicked the shit out of God of War.  IMO, it's still the best action game ever.  I expect NG2 to kick just as much ass.","c03n7wu":"They complain that the xbox is only getting sequels, but then say that the games to look out for on ps3 are GT5, MGS4, GoW3, and Resistance2?  Ok Gamepro.  Fucking tards.","c03n9cc":"I paid 1 month for xbox live because of CoD 4 but honestly it's just not worth it. I mean who in their right mind continues to pay for a game matchmaking service? If microsoft's servers actually hosted the game it would be a different story, but they don't.","c03nae4":"He also needs to get a new job that pays a little more.  If $60\/year is a strain on his budget, perhaps he should not be blowing his money on games.\n\nSeriously, it's not even a dollar a day.  It's $5\/month if you pre-pay.  How much money do people spend on coffee these days?  What about money spent on booze?  You can't even get two gallons of gas for the price of one month of xbox live.  People seriously need to put the cost of Xbox Live into perspective.","c03neuc":"I don't know what's worse, crazy child protection services or the fact that your own child would turn you into them. I mean sold out  to the fuzz for an xbox? That's some solid family values right there.","c03nf1w":"Why did they have problems?\n\nThey sold how many million xboxs over christmas?\n\nO yah, Halo 3 and COD4 out at the same time.  I knew peopl 50 years old buying Xbox 360's and live just to play COD4.\n\nEveryone and their mom got an xbox for christmas and tried using live. \n\nMicrosoft was stupid for not preemptively upgrading their network.  Of course this was 4 months ago and since January the service has been rock solid.","c03nfx2":" After the break I took (I couldn't connect at all) I knew there was talk of a free game due to the network outages, but I looked all over and couldn't see any message in Marketplace or anywhere.\n\n I ended up Googling xbox, free game, network  or something like that and found out the game name and people were saying the offer lasted for two weeks.\n\n Even now any time I connect I always get the \"Any\" connection never the best or medium. I mean I have a 15Mpbs down and 950Kbps up, port forwarding on my router for ports 88 UDP and 3074 UDP\/TCP that should do it.","c03ngqt":"Bullshit. I was addicted to Call of Duty 4 about that time and while it was not \"down\" it was not in a working state for at least half a month. You could always get into one or two games every few HOURS but that is not what I consider uptime.\n\nThat being said...xbox live is a great service and well worth the 4.50 a month I pay. Nintendo and Sony are not even remotely in the same league as Microsoft when it comes to online play. ","c03nhgd":"You cant comapre WOW to xbox live games. Xboxlives games rarely if ever do anything that changes much. WOW changes entire worlds and adds things they werent even though of existing before hand. The major patches that are released would normally cost the cost of an expansion pack. If they didnt have mothly fees we wouldnt have 1 expansion set so far but about 6","c03njvn":"Well if we can't get Blu-ray can we still keep the flashing red lights on the front of my xbox?","c03nmug":"Because this person is the source of this story, which is all over the blogosphere right now:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/gamerush.zoomshare.com\/files\/news\/002550_Australian_retailers_to_dump_Xbox_360.htm\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.maxconsole.net\/?mode=news&amp;newsid=26674\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.xbox360fanboy.com\/2008\/04\/06\/australian-retailers-consider-the-360-dead\/\r\n\r\nAnd about a thousand other re-telling of his BS story.","c03np2p":"I've got a coupla nicks from the xbox accessories packaging.

Why does a card need such durable packaging?","c03nsht":"&gt;&gt;Why does a card need such durable packaging?\n\n&gt;To survive the sea journey from China.\n\n*Xboxen make an annual migration to the mercury beaches of southern China to breed and lay their eggs. After the young boxen hatch, they instinctively crawl down the beach to swim to their ancestral feeding grounds. Along the way, parasites attach to their still-soft shells. These parasites bear a tough plastic coating known as a \"clamshell\" -- this prevents them from being chewed off during their hosts' grooming behavior.*\n\n*When the xboxen are harvested by electronics trawlers in the Gulf of Mexico, the parasites are usually pried off and processed separately. Some consider them a delicacy, though the tough shells deter all but the most tenacious.*","c03nue1":"It is complicated. There are NTSC vs. PAL issues and other sorts of things. I don't think Microsoft has gone out of their way to make these things have regions, but they sort of do.\n\nAnd anyway, even if you lived and Europe and bought an American DVD player and DVDs, it still wouldn't work correctly with a European TV set. Then, if you got an American TV set, it wouldn't plug into a European wall socket.

It's about playability. It is not possible to make a game that works on consoles that is worth it for a PC gamer to buy. \n\nMy gaming rig costs 2k. It can do all kinds of shit that consoles can't even dream of. And yet I'm expected to shell out 60 bucks + micro payments for each additional mod pack because the asshole xbox 360 users have to pay for the mods. I'm supposed to play the same game as people with gaming rigs that cost a quarter the price of mine?\n\nThat's supposed to be some kind of amazing incredible wonderful game?\n\nfuck that.

I never pirate any games anymore but i'm going to make a special effort to steal from bethesda for stealing my chance of seeing Fallout 3 the way it was meant to be.","c03omw7":"They will do their modpacks for Fallout the same way they did them for Oblivion. Which was not the model they used for TESIII Morrowwind. \n\nIt's true they sold expansions for morrowwind, but they also released a lot of free content with paches.\n\nThey couldn't do that for Oblivion because the XboX live people have to pay a usage fee to download content. It almost worked out that only the xbox people would have to pay for the mods but at the last minute Beth caved to microsoft and forced everyone to pay.\n\nI'm not a fan of microsoft. I hate the XboX. It was completely unacceptable to me to have to put up with my game experience being diminished because of xbox users.\n\nNone of this would be an issue if it were possible to get refunds for pc games.

Xbox LIVE != MGS.\r\n\r\nBut, you've taken one situation, that has nuance, and you've drawn it into some great big conspiracy.\r\n\r\nClearly, by my example, there *is* free DLC on Xbox LIVE.  I'd say more free DLC than the competitors, but here you are, saying \"oh noes!  they fight it!  its closed!!1!\" but the your reality isnt supported by the facts.\r\n\r\nCan we please dispense with your presumption to know about the relationship between LIVE and its 3rd party publishers (small or large).\r\n\r\n\r\nHow about the Band of Bugs XBLA title that gave away free DLC levels? -- small...\r\n\r\nHow about the free DLC for Vampire Rain and the new missions for Project Sylpheed? -- large...\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.1up.com\/do\/newsStory?cId=3161537\r\n\r\nFree GHIII music pack for St. Patricks Day;\r\nhttp:\/\/www.xboxamerica.com\/news\/1538\/Free-GHIII-DLC-on-the-Horizon\r\n\r\nFree Rock Band song \"still alive\" from Portal for April Fool's Day; http:\/\/www.xbox360fanboy.com\/2008\/02\/21\/gdc08-portals-still-alive-to-be-rock-band-dlc\/\r\n\r\n\r\nReally.

MS is ingrained... for sure..\r\n\r\nbut consumer choice is returning.. no longer is it going to be a technical barrier, just a bureaucratic one.  so while the gov may require it of businesses, home users can use whatever they like and still interface with the bus computers and apps if they need.  home computers will always be entertainment devices as well as work devices.  not all obviously, but a good portion of they will be.\r\n\r\ni personally think Microsoft should put vista on the xbox before they miss the boat and apple puts osx in the living room on a machine with a 3d card.  then you can run mac for your window manager, and play a windows game inside a window on a mac desktop on your huge 52\" plasma.\r\n\r\n","c03pomt":"Microsoft and Apple users are all fools. The difference is the Apple users are financially foolish in addition to knowing knowing about computers.\n\nMacs are what you get for your 13 year old daughter who can't be trusted to go on myspace without clicking random links and creating a massive trojan infestation.\n\nI use windows on all my machines. They never crash on me (except when my laptop overheats, but that is hardly the fault of windows). Ever. I don't use virus protection, yet they never get viruses. Ever. And I paid a hell of a lot less than I would have for equivalent mac machines, and mine are upgradeable. And I could play games on them, if I cared to.\n\nIt's all just a single learning curve. On one end of the spectrum you have linux, which is free, but will fluster a lot of people. On the other end is OSX, which is dumbed down so any inept idiot can use it, and it's more expensive, and also tied into the hardware, so to get the benefits of an idiot proof system, you need to pay double for everything. Unless you had a little know-how, and installed it on an 86, but if you could do that, you would obviously know enough about computers to not need OSX to hold your hand.\n\nAnd right in the middle is windows. It won't hold your hand too much, and will let you make disastrous mistakes if you want. And it runs on cheap non-branded hardware, while giving you a lot more freedom (due to all the programmers designing new niche programs for it all the time) than OSX. Try flashing an xbox360 dvd-drive's firmware with a mac. Try hacking apart guitar hero and putting in different songs with a mac. Without some virtual OS giving you the POWER OF WINDOWS, it won't be done, because mac users aren't programmers. None of them care enough to bother developing something like that.\n\nIf you know what's going on, a mac has little to offer. If you have no idea what you're doing and have money burning a hole in your pocket, then you are Apple's target customer. You may not get a very good computer for the money, but at least you'll be the proud recipient of scores of pats on the back from other people who were just as clueless and financially ignorant as yourself.","c03pon2":"My xbox shits on appleTV with the force of ten thousand prison riots, and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nJust sayin'...","c03ppy2":"Epic fail.

Could you sue Apple because their 68000 hardware could not run Windows? Could you sue Apple because System 7 did not run on an x86?

Its not something you could do quietly, so it would  be an act of rage. If thats the case it would be easily avoidable.\n\nWhat was actually learnt: The son learnt that  if he wants to be left alone by his mom and not have to do something - he either has to do it grudgingly or has to go even further than he did with the cleaner (He's already lost the 360 + internet, if he has nothing to lose, his mother now has no method of punishment, which is why this kind of punishment is bad). \n\nThe mother: If she thinks she \"won\" that confrontation by selling the 360, she's wrong, she's lost a bargaining chip and if she confronts her son to the same level as before that forced him to break a cleaner, he will probably do something even worse next time. Otherwise she has hopefully learnt the limit of how far she can push her son before backing off and letting the situation cool down. If this is the case then she will notice better behaviour and might think her method of punishment was the cause of this behaviour, when actually it was her behaviour change that caused his change.\n\nClearly his mother provoked him to the point where he broke the cleaner, now while breaking a vacuum cleaner is unacceptable, you don't just do something like that for no reason. I have 4 conclusions that I think this story is a combination of:\n\n1. The mother either leads a stressful life (single mum) and she takes it out on his son, who takes it out on a vacuum cleaner (and probably a lot of other things).\n\n2. The mother doesn't communicate well with her son and doesn't provide him with anywhere to vent out his thoughts\/feelings\/etc.\n\n3. The son is having troubles outside of home and is taking them out on his mother\/the cleaner.\n\n4.

An argument could be made with the real numbers.\n","c03u95t":"Dude, the price difference between the xbox and ps3 is $50.

The magazine is sponsored by Microsoft, and positions a rumor that xbox owners want to hear, during a time when they are deciding which system to buy the game for, and also discussing it with their friends.

They could know very well that the content isn't at the level of additional cities, but it's in their best interest to let that rumor soar.  \r\nLet me ask the question - Microsoft wrote a check to Rockstar games for exclusive downloadable content, without some type of description of what that content would be?  \r\nIf that is the case, then the content could be as small as a new radio station; and you are getting screwed.  \r\nIf it isn't the case (more likely, as you don't write a check for empty promises), then Microsoft is in a position to be realistic about what the content is, but is choosing not to - to the point of not correcting or commenting officially on a rumor in a magazine they sponsor.\r\n","c03ui6t":"lol, a definite \"unbiased\" review of xbox vs ps3 gta, on a site called sonydefenseforce.

When they're that old no one cares about piracy because they already cut off their own revenue stream by ceasing their production.\n\nI just don't see the point of getting the latest and greatest stuff like most people do.  I do kind of feel left out when my friends start talking about new TV shows or video games, but then again they're all deep in debt and I'm not, and I'll end up playing all the games they do in a few more years anyway, but for now I can keep myself occupied with a whole bunch of titles that are somewhat outdated.  No one could possibly play through all of the old titles by the time the new consoles come out (unless they have absolutely no life), so why not just stay with them for a while until you need to move on to the next generation?

Just like it is with books.\n\nYou certainly can't look at the community of gamers and say they've opposed the ESRB, can you?  The comics industry and comics readers opposed the CCA.  The film industry regularly lambasts the MPAA and their ultrapuritanical reign (check out \"This Film Is Not Yet Rated\").  Who speaks out against the ESRB?  Or the foreign bodies that have the backing of the armed police of the government?  No one.  It's a deserted island I shout from.  I think there's like one other dude here who wrote a book that people tried to burn but everyone else is over on the other shore, bending over as far as they can, just pleading with the ESRB to tell them how old their kid should be before they can play GTA IV.\n\nHoenstly, I understand you think I was overlooking the Comics Code and thought you'd get to look all impressive pointing it out and insulting my grasp of history.  But look at it objectively.  The comics code was never as restrictive.  The comics code was opposed.  The comics code was never so powerful that it could completely eliminate the market for any comic it deemed inappropriate.

In it you play as a guy who has no memory of where he came from in this weird facility.\n\n what made it different from other FPS games was that he was a bad shot, but a great martial arts expert, so mostly you were going around beating up of almost everything but you had special powers that allowed you to beat down your enemies. \n\n one of the best things about break down was that you never left your characters perspective. ever. like if you went to get health you would have to find a ration bar, unwrap it, and eat it. you went to a vending machine, chose the soda, button pressed, it picked up the soda, popped the top and drank it. \nOne more great thing was that as the game progressed you got more and more powers like the ability to stop bullets with your arms, shoot energy balls, and slow down time. \n\n  There have been only 2 other games that i have played that were even close in terms of the greatness that breakdown had. One was **Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay**, that one was great and it had 3rd person platforming parts that really made it stand out. \n\nthe people that developed chronicles for riddick also developed another one of my favorite games, **the darkness** which is a game in which you are a mobster, die, and come back with a demon in your body. The thing I loved about it was if you turn your head you can see your shoulders and about 1\/3rd of the way into the game you get these tentacle things which you can use to impale people and just throw their lifeless corpses to the side. it really feels like playing a FPS as the alien from alien, you have to stay in the darkness for you to have power, and you get a little stealth tentacle which can kill people real nice.\n\n my third favorite game would have to be **we love katamari** \nit was the best one of the series it had the most variety and fun, even if the newer ones have more stuff they don't compare to we love katamari. or maybe it would be something more old scool like mario or pong. i bet no one will read this long incredibly unimportant reply but i made it and thats what counts.","c04fj5y":"Are telling me you can't get a used xbox, xbox360, ps1, ps2, or old PC to play games on.

I'm mostly using the Ps3 but both system have good games, which is what matter. \nBecause of the fabled xbox hardware unreliability, I tend to buy multi-platform title on the Ps3. It's a well built system.  I work at a game company and people around me seem to prefer the Ps3 as a gaming system, until they have to program on it :)\n\nSo, if you do not care about xbox live and are willing to spend a little extra money for switching to a new console, I think you wouldn't regret it. You'll have a reliable system with good games that will be able to play blue-ray movies if you get interested in that later. Not to mention the game content that you simply can't fit inside a normal dvd, in the long run that's going to hinder XBox.","c04fvi3":"I've got both, bought my xbox early last year, and my ps3 late last year. Honestly, since getting the PS3 I havn't even touched my 360, it's still in the box from the last time I moved. The only thing that keeps calling to me is Call Of Duty 4, and that just isn't worth the extra clutter of cords. In summary: xbox exclusives aren't THAT great, dead rising is pretty fun but halo? gears of war? you've played these games, they're nothing special.","c04fvka":"I got the 360 at launch, and I used it fairly often until I got my ps3 a little over a year ago. I only use my 360 for rock band and the occasional downloadable game every now and then.\n\nI get almost all multiplatform titles for PS3, mainly because of the superior controller.  Also, the system menus are much more visually pleasing and seem to flow smoother. The 360s blades seem antiquated compared to the PS3s XMB. \n\nThe PS3 has a number of games that I would probably not normally have played, some of which were on the previously mentioned list. Heavenly Sword was a (short) blast, Resistance was one of the best shooters I've played, and some of the downloadable games are breathtaking - especially Everyday Shooter. And of course MGS4 is amazing! The ps2 back catalogue is a must mention as well...\n\nI also like the media features, which previously ranked extremely low on my priorities when choosing a console . The DVD\/Bluray player is vastly superior to the 360 player in terms of navigation and ease of menu usage if you dont own the respective console's extra remote control. The PS3 video and music playback is seamless and well integrated, allowing for a simplicity that often finds me playing albums on my tv (with the awesome visualizations) rather than opening my laptop and loading up clunky itunes.\n\nIntegration with the PSP is also alot of fun if you have one. Features like remote play and downloadable handheld content were once novelties, but are finally coming into their own.\n\nThe network support, while not quite reaching xbox live levels, is always improving. The newly redesigned store is wonderful, and multiplayer is usually fine as long as you have patience.\n\nOverall, I enjoy both systems, but find the PS3 far more satisfying on numerous levels. Alot of my points might not apply to you now (psp, online, etc.) but keep in mind you'll have this system for years to come, so theres plenty of features to grow into over time. Good luck making a choice!","c04fvoy":"I have both (all three actually). The only game I really played on my PS3 was MGS4 (though I have bought six other titles) and that only lasted 20 hours.

I don't play online much, and a lot of my favorite games at the moment are either PS3 exclusives (MGS4, Devil May Cry 4, Ratchet and Clank) or multiplatform (GTA4, Oblivion) and I prefer the ps3 controller.\n\nOn the other hand, I use the 360 for media far more than the PS3.  Although the PS3 has nice upscaling, and I have a few bluray movies, I really like being able to rent movies and buy tv shows off the xbox live marketplace.\n\nI also tend to play the 360 more for quick games off Xbox Live Arcade, since a lot of the games on the PSN are crappy, and the selection is a lot smaller.","c04gh95":"Wow, these boys really need an xbox360","c04gr3c":"If you're going to come up with some 'industrial design' that has no basis in reality, and pass it off as some kind of rumour, then at least have the decency to try to make the device *realistic*.

When I plugged it in it sounded like I had turned a hair dryer on.  When I started to play the football game it froze up.  I thought maybe it needs to be turned on it's side, so I did.  Mid-turn I heard it scratch my friends football game.\n\nSo with all of these concerns I googled and read about the known defects of the box.\n\nWhen I tried the ps3 it didn't have the cool online part, but it worked and was quiter.\n\nI haven't had one problem with my ps3.\n\nMoral of the story, if you read up before your purchase you wouldn't have a broken gaming system.

The fact that you can imperitively override the behavior is not nearly as valuable as having declarative time and event based animation - which Flash does not.\n\nAgain you are confusing: what the IDE gives and what is possible. If I was an artist using the Flash IDE I would use keyframes. I am a programmer and I can use whatever I want for animations: time or frames. In fact Flex doesn't even have the concept of \"frames\" at all built in (unless you are dealing with assets provided by an artist using the IDE).\n\n&gt; It's an improvement, but pretending that Flex Builder is common in production use and anything close to the defacto standard for doing Flash work is pretty disingenuous.\n\nTell that to recruiters who call me. The last 3 projects I have worked on required Flex Builder knowledge. \n\n&gt; Neither of those address the point that I stated which was that Flash's shape and animation format is binary.\n\nYou mean the SWF itself and not the language used to generate the SWF. I understand, although I have no love for XML being used in its place. To me that is a weakness (given the SWF is an open format, no less standard than XAML really).\n\n&gt; how can you even begin to speculate that it \"makes silverlight look pretty weak in comparison.\"\n\nBecause evidence supports it. There are examples of amazing things being done in Flex with no comparisons to equally impressive silverlight examples.

If you are into Picture editing check out [Picnick](http:\/\/www.picnik.com\/).\n\nFinally even if we consider silverlight and Flash platform to be equal - the adoption rate of Flash Player is much higher. The developer community is larger.\n\nI'm thinking my passing familiarity with a new platform is still a better understanding than prejudice held from a 3 year old view of a platform.\n\nAnd I am willing to learn. Show me what I'm missing because I have looked for it and it isn't easy to see.\n\nNone of this detracts from my original comment: You assume MS is better when it is not. With the xbox, with Silverlight and perhaps many other things. I have provided evidence to the contrary (for both) not just words. Can you do the same to back up your claim (that silverlight is technologically superior to flash)?\n\n**Update:** I just had a look at MS silverlight demo site [Tafiti](http:\/\/tafiti.mslivelabs.com\/) and compared it to Adobe's online [photoshop express](https:\/\/www.photoshop.com\/express\/index.html?bypass&amp;wf=testdrive). I think that gives a good show of the relative merits of the technologies currently available in both platforms and shows silverlight really is a joke.

Most people expected that MGS4 would be a system seller, and would significantly increase the number of consoles sold during the month of it's release; especially since the wii did not have any comperable major releases.\n\n&gt; The Nintento Wii is a new and fun experience. It's innovative and opens up a whole new world of games from Wii sports to Wii Fit to what ever. It's even backwards compatible with the Gamecube and its controllers and memory card.\n\nThe wii is a fairly unique experience at first, but in reality it's not all that innovative.  From a technological standpoint, the only thing nintendo has really done is take existing technology and make it affordable.  All of the pointing and motion sensing technology used in the wii has been available for years.  The system architecture is basically just an overclocked gamecube.  Most of the games would play no different with a mouse or standard controller.\n\n&gt;All in All, it's a fun, affordable entertainment system. The fun may wear off after a few months but that's irrelevant.\n\nThe wii certainly does have enough good games to qualify as fun and affordable for a short period of time, but console wars are marathons, not sprints, and unless nintendo is able to do somethign to counteract the shovelware and get some better titles on the system, the wii is doomed to be nothing more than a really common doorstop.\n\n&gt; The PS3 is impressive. It has beautiful graphics, BlueRay player, great online stuff but...well...it's a PS3. A slightly better PS2. That's a slightly better PS1. That's a slightly better SNES. Where is the innovation, where is the fun?\n\nand a ferrari is just a slightly better version of a horse and buggy.  It's disingenuous to pretend that you cant recognize the significant architectural leaps in game consoles over the last 15 years.  Ideas from the PS2 were certainly used in the PS3, but the cell processor was a huge step forward in processor design.  We've only started to see hints of what can be built on top of next-gen systems.  It's not just about prettier and higher resolution graphics, it's about better physics and AI, and more immersive, more connected worlds.\n\n&gt; Sorry but I've got Metal Gear Solid 1, 2 and 3. Metal Gear solid 4 would be good if I wasn't bored from having done it all before.\n\nBig name franchises are big money spinners, a lot of people still like playing the next metal gear solid, grand turismo, etc.  That's not to say that there aren't new games being released as well.  Games like Echochrome, LittleBigPlanet, and Flow bring new ideas to gaming, while new franchises like Resistance FoM, Folklore, etc. bring new takes on classic genres.  The PS3 has plenty of \"just another release of game X\" titles, but so does the wii have far more than it's share of 'just another minigame collection'\n\n&gt; I've played Gran Turismo 1, 2, 3 and 4. There is nothing left to offer anybody. A PS3 offers fractionally better 90s games. \n\nsee above.  you can't speak for everyone, plenty of people still like the traditional genres, and it's not as though everything on the wii is groundbreaking, the wii just favors rehashes in a few specific genres.\n\n&gt; The game building techniques haven't changed.\n\nOn the contrary, there have been a number of improvements in game development techniques.  I would say that if any system was going to be accused of lack of innovation in this area though, it would be the wii, the system with the most ports of last-gen titles.\n\n&gt; The stories haven't improved. \n\nIn the SNES era, most games didn't even have stories.  In the PS1 era, the stories were generally fairly weak and hokey.  It's only been toward the end of the PS2 era and the beginning of the current generation that we have starting to see truly amazing film and novel quality storylines in games like GTA4, Assassins Creed, etc.\n\n&gt; It's just the same shit with better textures. Look at the control pads. That is the improvement in 20 years of keeping the SNES control pad style.\n\nControl pads work.  There are a large set of games that have control schemes that simply don't work with only 1 or 2 buttons, and the wii has provided ample evidence that waggling a remote at the screen is not always a superior solution.  Also, controls have really nothing to do with texture resolution.\n\n&gt; Sony got into this gig by doing a cheap console that's easy for people to write games for. \n\nActually, no.  During the PS1 era, all the systems were hard to program for, because nobody really got 3D, although the PS1 was considered easier than the N64 because of the larger size of CDs, and a better texture memory architecture.  Still, of the last-gen systems, the PS2 was notoriously hard to develop for, much more difficult than the gamecube or the xbox.  I think you are really thinking of Microsoft here, who benefitted both from a cost perspective and an ease of development perspective by using pretty much bog-standard x86 pc hardware for the original xbox.\n\n&gt; No \"Nintendo seal of approval\" bullshit. \n\nYes; one of the lessons Nintendo learned from Sony was the benefit of being more open to different types of games.  Sony does quality testing, just like Nintendo and Microsoft.  Up until the PS1 era though, Nintendo had a huge stranglehold over the types of games that could be released.  Sony took more gambles and in doing so allowed games that introduced a number of new genres.  If you are going to keep beating the 'innovation' dead horse, then really you should look at that bit of history.\n\n&gt; Now they are trying to pedal some \"entertainment\" system that has cool black lines and nothing new to offer. \n\nSony and Microsoft are both on the 'home media center' bandwagon, while Nintendo is remaining resolutely in the 'just games' camp.  The better strategy remains to be seen, but it certainly looks like there are a lot of people who are interested in having a single appliance in their entertainment center to handle photos, music, movies, downloads, PVR functionality, and games.\n\n&gt; I don't care if it has a hard disk (that's just the same as a memory card) or a BlueRay player (that's just a better VCD player) or an Internet connection (thats just a better serial link cable \/ multitap).\n\nOnce again, this is just completely disingenuous.  Hard drive capability is there as an enabling technology to make the digital media center aspect of the systems work.  Plenty of people might not care much about bluray yet, but saying it's just a better VCR is like saying that a VCR is just a better version of a flip-book; and if the internet is nothing new or worthwhile, what are you doing on reddit?  Online play might not be new, but it is a major feature that is finally getting prime-time among both Microsoft and Sony.  Online functionality is also being explored in more unique ways than just to enable remote multiplayer.  We are only beginning to see the start of what real internet-enabled gameplay will be in the future.\n\n&gt; The games are boring and have been done to death. It's always classic genres and nothing we haven't already seen. Sure I could waste my life in COD4 but if it never came out, I'd still be content firing up Unreal Tournament.\n\nI've mentioned before that there are new and innovative titles available on the PS3 and 360.\n\n&gt; People need a reason to buy a console and I can't see a single game worth buying on the PS3 that can't be gotten on the PS2\n\nWell, there are very few specific games available for both the PS2 and PS3, and in those cases, generally the PS2 port was done by a third party and is of lesser quality.  Of course, you are actually trying to make the implication that there is no innovation and that games on current-gen systems are merely clones of last-gen titles.  I've attempted already to show why this isn't true.\n\nIn closing; there are some innovative aspects to the Wii, just as there are innovative aspects to the PS3.  Both consoles have some unique and interesting games, and both consoles have their share of crappy games.  The wii inparticular has a horrendous problem with shovelware, and at this point has done very little to prove the validity of it's controller - which is the closes thing to innovative that the system has.  Wii Sports is one of the few games that makes real use of the full motion sensing capabilities of the system; most other games use the wiimote as a mouse, and occasionally tack on some additional motion sensing, and in most cases do so fairly poorly.  Games like Wii Fit may be innovative, but speak no more to the inherent innovativeness of the system than games like Guitar Hero or Sing Star, or Eye of Judgement; since the wii balance board is an extra parephrial.  The wii does have some good games, but the best of them could easily be played with a standard controller, and might be better off for it.  Wii Ware may improve the situation, but as it stands, games for the playstation network and the xbox live arcade offer far more room for innovation from indy developers than the wii has shown.\n\nSpeaking as someone who owns all three current-gen systems, I think that most of the standard pro-wii rhetoric is misguided.  There are certainly areas where the wii excels (a cheap system with a few fun casual games, not much of anything with depth, and mostly a new spin on traditional arcade and carnival style titles, easy to pick up for non-gamers) but sticking by the \"wii is the only innovative system\" line is not only wrong, if you say it enough, you might start to believe it, which is a shame, because if you really want to see innovating in gaming, you are missing out on some real gems by completely disregarding the other systems.","c04kn0d":"Haha the idea that the Wii is better is laughable. I got my PS3 for 400 with a 100 gift card, so really it is only 50 dollars cheaper. Then you add in the fact that it has no hard drive and piss poor graphics compared to the xbox or ps3 and it doesn't have any media support either(dvd or blu ray). \n\nI don't think you will ever be able to convince me that having the ability to wave my hands around when I play makes the gaming experience better.","c04kuo3":"&gt;Some of the junk that gets added to laptops is what makes them cheap. There's a reason that you can (or could) get a Windows laptop with lots of \"partner software\" bundled for less than a Linux laptop (without associated crap) from Dell. If you can reinstall over it, you're \"beating the system\".\r\n\r\n   What a load of bullshit, the ubuntu version of a dell xbox m1330 was only 20 or 30$ more expensive than the windows equivalent last time I checked, that's not much when you consider your paying 1000+ for a laptop. Also macbooks are at almost the same price too without any bloat.","c04kzqa":"so why blizard doesn't make an xbox 360 version of their games?\nIt's not that MS doesn't care about pc gaming, for many people the only reason to still use windows, is to play pc games.DX 10 has been developed to help game developers, not others.\nBlizard became famous with pc games mainly on windows.\nMS own games probably won't hit the shelves before, or simultaneously, the launch of the XBOX 360 counterpart.\nI think it's pretty obviuos...","c04l3k2":"meh. lets look at the support that the other two mainstream computer operating systems have, and lets think about that some more.\r\n\r\ni don't see the level of gaming support across the whole marketplace on osx, and linux that we see on windows. \r\n\r\nsure, microsoft also has a console, but to say it doesn't care about gaming on windows is just stupid, and wrong. hence the games for windows initiative, (which is rumoured to be getting a 'reboot' soon.) although i can agree it perhaps doesn't care about it as much as it cares about the xbox, why is that?\r\n\r\nbecause there's competition there, and it's because there's more at stake with consoles as they try to control the living room, and the tv. microsoft are going head to head against sony in that front, and that's going to take a lot of $$$ to compete.

Skipping using a PC is a a feature, it will be convenient. Before DivX support you could watch DivX through manipulation of your media server for PS3... native support was still a very welcomed addition.\n3.

She has 3 daughters, and 2 of them play the wii.  They kind of play it as a family, except my sister and her husband are drunk a lot, so I think it gets kind of competitive.  My dad saw the baseball game, and he thought it would be fun to play, so we played... for about an hour and some change.\n\nThe Wii is so simple that my 5 year old niece can figure it out, and my 60 year old father can figure it out.  On top of that, it has some pretty good games that are really fun to play.  The Wii sells well because it's fun, easy, less expensive, and marketed to a lot more people than the ps3 &amp; xbox.

Apparently they get their joy not from playing video games, but from other people not being able to play video games.\r\n\r\nIt's an incredibly selfish and immature mindset that is prevalent on the internet. I say make everything cross platform if the system can handle it. PS3 guys can play Halo and Gears if I get to play MGS4 and God of War.","c04qqrw":"It only outsold in the article because of averages, not necessarily on a month by month basis and mgs4 pushing a shitload of ps3 and price drop, also it's a month out of date, so it's possible the avg's could have swapped around, also they BARELY beat xbox with the highest profile game of the system and a price drop. If you think that trend is going to continue now that mgs4 has dropped, you are most likely mistaken.\n\nI'm sure when gears 2 comes out or some other high profile xbox games that the sales will swap again.

Cuil, being new and having fewer users, doesn't have that.  If this is true, the rankings on Cuil should be decent for very popular search terms (which will more easily accumulate user feedback) and pretty poor for unpopular search terms.\n\nThis actually seems to be the case, by the way:  I searched for \"xbox\" and \"wii\" and got the obvious results at the top of the search page for both Google and Cuil.  I also searched for \"shoal creek hike bike trail\" (meaning that I want info about a specific hike and bike trail here in Austin), and the most useful page was way down on the list on Cuil, whereas Google had the result I wanted right at the top of the list.\n\nBasically what I'm saying is that their technology might be fine; it just might be that their system needs time to learn what web users want to see in search results.","c04uja9":"yeah the xbox does that too.  even does the same for streamed content from my hdd.

Everyone that I know who has a wii and the 360 spend a vast majority of their time on the 360, most sell the Wii.  We sell them because we are bored by cheaply made, gimmicky games.\n\nBlu-ray is retarded, overpriced bullshit.  DVDs look fine, but Wii owners don't even get that.  You can stream netflix through the xbox straight to your tv.  There are lots of free downloadable content too.  Halo 3 currently has 4 maps available for free, Rockband has about 3 free songs.

To say blu-ray looks fine is like sayingyour halo3 looks as good on a standard TV set as it would in High-def. In effect, you pretty much advocate the mentality of the Wii owners, as they are playing games that \"look just fine\" on their standard def setup. I digress, in fact blu-ray provides 50Gb of game data per disc, and your xbox games can only reach 9Gb. Besides playing movies, you get better games.\n\n\n\nAlso, I noticed you have a nice neat category for Wii Gamers, who are not really gamers, like I'm sure you are yourself, who probably doesn't have a Wii. I can assure you that people who play games on the Wii are gamers, just like people who played Zedlda on the Original Nintendo were gamers, and the people who played pong on the Atari years before them. Your idea of a gamer being only people who own the Xbox is retarded.\n\n\nI hate to sink to the level of ad-hominem attack on your character, but since you have not provided any valid arguments to counter-argue, I'll just have to conclude you are Ignorant, or arrogant, or even both. \n\n\nHave a nice day.","c04z4xl":"I've stated, multiple times, that I own a Wii.\n\n  Theoritically you might get better games on a blu ray, based purely on the fact that theres more room for better textures and higher quality, but in reality the PS3 has one good exclusive game, MGS4.  Every multiplatform game looks exactly the same on the 360 as on the PS3, Unless they just don't compress anything there is really no reason to use 50 gigs.  In practice the 360 has better games than the PS3. And I don't care about blu-ray because I don't watch dvds, and they haven't proven themselves useful for games.  Intuitive gameplay through better programming makes a game better, not massively insane amounts of unnecessary information. Also Blu ray is slow as fuck.  Whoever said more game data is better?  MGS has vastly more amounts of \"game data\" than any other game produced and yet it isn't nearly the greatest game ever.\n\n\nI've played wii's version of network gaming through super smash bros,  I found it unwieldy and more hassle than its worth.  I played network gaming on PS2 and found that to be hard to use also.  \n\nThe reason I much prefer xbox's is because of the friends list, the common guide that runs seperate from the game so I know what games my friends are playing, exactly what they are doing in that game, join up with them, if possible, send them messages, private chat, and send them screenshots and videos from my game.  Sure you can get some of those features with the ps3, but it's also a playstation 3, which has, in my opinion, crappy games and a shitty controller. From my perspective PSN users are not paying anything because if they were charged than nobody would play it, because vast majority of networked console games are on the 360.   Also, enjoy having a controller that doesn't rumble. \n\n","c04z57h":"I was specifically talking about the guys whining about paying for downloadable content, when I said it is simple business.  They make a product, the downloadable content, like extra songs for rockband, that costs them money to make. There are royalties to the artist, they NEED to charge for it.   PSN has downloadable content also, at the same exact price.  PSN has just much less downloadable content in general.\n\n\nBut if you were talking about networked gaming in general, Not all network gaming is the same, because not every console is the same.  The Playstation 3 has a terrible, rumbleless controller, it has less people playing the online games, and it has much less games.\n\nI got my new, premium 360 for 200 dollars, people have bought the PS3 for 600 dollars.  Xbox live costs 50 dollars a year.  I get to have 8 years of xbox with live before I spend as much as somebody who has Playstation 3 with PSN. The consoles will be obsolete by then, following the 5 year rule. So who got the better deal?  You completely disregard upfront price.  Ever think that maybe all the playstation 3 owners think they have a better product because they spent three times as much as me? \n\nThis phenomena is known as \"denial and rationalization\"\n","c04z6wv":"This was the game that caused me to get an xbox, but it's nice to have it ported to those who only have one console.

I have an xbox 360 and a PC, and I play the PC a lot more, even on a small monitor. Here's my counterpoints (note there are pros and cons to both systems but these are some things he glossed over):\n\n-- Most importantly: you can duplicate most of the benefits of a console on a PC, by using a DVI-HDMI cable and an xbox 360 controller with your PC. This is actually a HIGHER resolution in most cases than the xbox can render.\n\n-- Non-gimped FPS, RTS, and turn-based strategy. A mouse and keyboard is not the end-all-be-all control system, for sure. It's missing analog inputs and it's not the most ergonomic thing in the world. But there's no doubt that it's the better implement for most FPS games-- you don't need autoaim on the PC. AFAIK, all console FPS games use some autoaim. As for the RTS games, mouse and keyboard are FAR better. RTSs are starting to move to the console, but with slower play, annoying controls, and simplistic gameplay. Show me Company of Heroes or Homeworld on a console and I'll say that we're getting close to even in that field. As for turn based strategy-- Civilization, Total War, GalCiv, etc-- they either don't exist or are, again, simplified (CivRev, I'm looking at you.)\n\n-- Better graphics. Yes, an enthusiast machine puts out better visuals than any console. End of story.\n\n-- More \"Exclusives.\" More games are made only for the PC than are made only for a specific console. This ties into point two.\n\n-- Free online play. Self explanatory.\n\n-- MMOs. If you like these, you have to play on PC.\n\n-- Upgradability and Backwards Compatibility. A PC can be upgraded slowly as it ages; a console is a larger investment every 4 years. Consoles are catching up in terms of backwards compatibility, but they aren't there yet.\n\n-- Larger HDDs. I have a 600gb raid array on my PC, and while that's a pain for a standard gamer the price per gig on a PC is far cheaper allowing for more DLC and DLC of full games rather than \"arcade\" games.\n\n-- Multipurpose platform. I can develop a webpage on the same machine I play Call of Duty on.\n\n-- Regular patches with detailed patch notes. This isn't a feature of all games, but enough games come out with detailed patches on the PC that it's a valid point. Very few games get patched regularly on the consoles, partially because of vetting issues with the manufacturer.\n\nI'll add more if I think of them. For sure, there are downsides to the PC like expense, drivers for hardware, DRM issues, no fighting games (They really do play a lot better on consoles), difficulty playing local multiplayer, etc. However, this argument was absurdly one-sided. I play both systems, and I split my time about 70-30 between them, with the skew towards PC. For mindless action games, the console is dominant. But for deeper games that I find more entertaining most of the time, I love my PC.","c0509tr":"Consoles' biggest advantage vs. PC is that consoles have a uniform hardware setup and the developers work VERY hard to make sure the game works perfectly (or as close as possible) within the constraint of the system.  When buying an xbox 360 game, you know it's going to work on your system.   You don't have to check OS, memory, video card, audio card, etc. before purchasing.  \n\nYou may think this means lower quality games as compared to PC as time goes on, but I would argue that it does not.  As time goes on, developers learn more and more tricks to get their games to run better on the limited hardware.  Just compare 1st year PS2 games to the ones that have come out in the past couple years; it's no contest.  PC games, on the other hand, are written with the top-of-the-line hardware in mind, because rather than push the limits of what their code can do within certain constraints, they push the limits of what the best hardware on the market can do.  And this means that for every significantly better game that comes out, you will likely have to buy not only the game, but some upgraded piece of hardware that may be near the price of a new xbox360 all by itself. (I have a brand new, high-end software development laptop that can't even run the spore character creator, and you better believe that no matter how much I desperately want that game, I'm not going to build a whole new PC just to play it.)\n \nThe fact is that for one investment of under $500, you have many years' worth of gaming excitement at your fingertips with no need of an upgrade.  Good luck even building a PC that can play the latest games for $500, let alone the upgrades that will be necessary down the line.\n\nSide note:  We can all admit keyboard and mouse are better for FPS and especially RTS games, but if you actually take a couple weeks to practice you get quite good with the controller, and it's well worth the trade-off for all the reasons listed above and by the article's author.","c0509xt":"I gave up PC gaming when I was unable to re-install Morrowind because its DRM didn't like my DVD burner.\n\nBut it's not only DRM.  I have a bunch of PC games that I just can't play anymore because they were designed for Windows 98 and won't work on XP or Vista, or what-have-you.  Dungeon Keeper 2 is a good example of a game I own that I can't play anymore (there are some hacks online that *might* get it working, but it causes serious gameplay bugs for the few people that can even get it to install).\n\nAt least I know that I can still play Morrowind on my xbox 10 years from now (thanks to BC, I can even play it on my 360).","c050a2n":"True, I cannot deny that there are distinct advantages to consoles, especially the Xbox (which is significantly more straightforward to write for than the labyrinthine mess of the PS3 architecture).\n\nI would disagree with the need to upgrade; my graphics card is almost a year old and it's still running everything at full resolution and full settings. In fact, my expected lifespan on a piece of hardware is 3-4 years. The only individual component that costs the same as an xbox is the graphics card; most upgrades are under $100.\n\nAs for the initial cost, a PC is more expensive, which I noted. However, the ability to use a PC for other functions is great. The fact is, for $1,000 I could build a PC on the day of a console's release that would likely outperform that console for the entirety of that console's lifespan.\n\nAs for an apples-to-apples comparison, I can run Mass Effect PC and CoD4 PC at a higher resolution, detail level, and framerate than on my xbox. So can my roommate, and his processor\/video card is older than the xbox. The argument about performance is simply not true. The PC significantly outperforms consoles in every benchmark on every game-- as it should. An enthusiast PC is twice the price, and that's the real downside here.\n\nAs for console FPS games, I play them a lot-- as I say, I split my time about 70-30 and I'm a hardcore gamer. I can't get my H3 fix on the PC, so I play on the 'box. It's not a *bad* control scheme, by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a slight tilt towards the PC.\n\nYou're spot-on about the biggest weakness of the PC being cost, which I'll never debate. Intelligent shopping and building your own machine can greatly increase the longevity and narrow the price gap, but even the best shopper will be hard pressed to create a gaming machine for under $1000, which is solidly twice as much as any console, at least. I like them both, but my system of choice will likely always be the PC because of superior performance and versatility. Since I need a powerful machine for the non-gaming stuff I do anyway, it's not a stretch to invest in a really solid machine. I certainly understand the primary-console-gamers viewpoint-- it's just that when I weigh the pros and cons I have to tilt towards the PC.","c050adj":"It's not really a matter of seeing people as much as the stuff surrounding it. Textures are more detailed, there's more objects, smoke fills in better... it's minor, but it looks better. The bigger issue for me with CoD4 in particular is the game pacing; it's about twice as fast on the PC as the xbox, and I love the extra speed. The reason is the input method; it's faster to shoot using a mouse.\n\nAlso, a lot of games actually run in 720P rather than 1080P on the xbox. I was dismayed to learn this about Soul Calibur 4-- it's 1080P in the menus and then actually drops to 720P in matches, so that they can say that it's 1080P. I don't know about CoD4, because again, I play it almost exclusively on the PC, but they do do that every once in a while.\n\nAlso, check out some comparison shots from Mass Effect-- that makes a (pardon) massive difference.\n\nAgain, it's no big deal, since I enjoy both platforms, but if you can swing the expense and the slight additional effort, it's worth it in my opinion. One last thing-- one of the most frustrating myths is that it costs $3000 to get a good machine, when a really solid machine can be built for $1000, so the price thing isn't as out of line as a lot of people think.\n\nEither way, I'm not trying to \"convert\" you or anything; just laying out the pros and cons of both systems as someone who loves-- and plays-- them both.","c050afg":"xbox live approaches $3\/month if you buy a 13-month card online.

It has the most enjoyable games that stay fresh even after you've played it for a while, thanks to the fun multiplayer modes. Playing online is free, you can buy nostalgia games from the wii shop and earn stars to trade for goodies.\nA ps3 is too expensive for what it offers. It's (or at least was) the cheapest Blu-ray player, but Blu-ray requires a HD tv, and its image isn't that much of a difference from regular dvd. The exlusive games for the Ps3 are very sub-par, most of the good ones also come for windows, xbox and\/or wii.\nThe xbox is prone to hardware failure, but halo 3 alone would be a reason to get it.","c051gsq":"The 360 seems to have the strongest game library at the moment. If playing HD movies is important, then obviously PS3 is the way to go. Otherwise, most of the decent 360 games are also available on PS3, and there are good PS3 exclusives as well.\n\nBoth systems work fairly well as media players, playing common internet video formats (DivX\/XviD\/MP4\/H.264). I believe only the 360 will play WMV\/VC-1 files, but I could be wrong about that. Both will play streaming over the network or off discs, and you can load media onto the PS3's HD.\n\nI own a 360 and I am pretty happy with it. Because it has a large installed base, used games go for fairly cheap on ebay, and original Xbox titles go for even cheaper. The lineup of games on the xbox live arcade is pretty decent as well, and go for $5-$20 a pop. Don't let people convince you that the cost of Xbox live is a huge detriment. Buy a 13-month prepaid card at buy.com or whatever and it approaches $3\/month. If you don't play games online then you don't even need it. Everything else (save for the upcoming Netflix integration) works on the free \"Silver\" xbox live accounts. Either use rechargeable AA batteries with the controller, or splurge for microsoft's battery pack which charges through a usb cable (about $18 online, cheaper if you buy 3rd party).\n\nI cannot necessarily recommend a Wii unless you have a particular fondness for Mario\/Zelda\/Samus\/etc.","c051gus":"I own both the PS3 and the 360, and here is my reasons to go with PS3:\n\n\n* accessories: Microsoft is in the selling accessories to screw you business. The PS3 has a built-in wifi, and on Xbox that is a $100 add-on. You cannot even get the HD-DVD accessory anymore, but if you could that was another $150. To get a decent wireless headphone+mic you have to buy a Microsoft accessory, and those cost a lot. On PS3 you can use the blue-tooth headset from your cell phone.\n* Movies: Both consoles let you download movies online, but only one of them lets you download HD movies, and that would be the PS3. OF course only one console has built-in capability to view blu-ray movies, and upscale DVDs, again the PS3.\n* The PS3 has a web browser that supports flash animations and you-tube movies. You can surf reddit on your PS3, and it's a nice feature.\n* Of the two consoles, one of them is louder than the other because of the DVD drive whirls around too much. Unfortunately this is the same reason the 360 sometimes scratches games, the malfunctioning DVD drive never spins down, and has no variable rate. It is either as loud as a box-fan, or dead.\n* PSN versus XBL: Firstly many people will claim that XBL is superior, but when pressed as to why, it is always because more of their friends are on XBL, not for any technical reasons. Here are some reasons I think PSN is better: 1) the sign-up process is not so convoluted, especially if you want to link from a previous xbox live account. On Sony you just provide a username, a credit-card number, and email address. Very simple process. On Microsoft you have a major ordeal, but once setup the experience is good.\n* HDMI? IF you choose the 360 and you want High-def, you better go with the more expensive elite 360, the only model that has an HDMI port. Of course that is a standard feature on the PS3.\n* If you have a digital camera, you can connect the memory card into the PS3, and it will produce a slide show in a few cool animated forms. A few cool feature, and unfortunatly the 360 has no memory card ports whatso ever.\n* Linux: you can install a full desktop linux into the PS3, and do just about anything you can on a regular computer.\n* Games: you have just as many good games on one console or the other, but the 360 has more exclusive titles. Problem about the games argument is until you are the person who owns every single game title for whatever console you're a fan-boy..... you get the point. Both consoles have no shortage of good games, mostly the same games too. My advice is to ignore anybody who says games look better on one console or the other, or the number of games on one versus the other. \n\nI hope I don't sound like a PS3 fan boy, because really I'm not. I just happen to own both consoles, but if I were forced to give one up right now under a gun, I'd have to keep the PS3 for the reasons given above. ","c051h5v":"Playing games on the 360 is about all it CAN do, so naturally that is the one only argument the 360 fan can fall-back to when in a corner.\n\n\nNaturally both consoles play games equally well.\n\n\nBut you have to consider the extra abilities you might want that come default on the PS3.\n\nI stand corrected, only the Xbox elite, and the xbox premium have the HDMI port. This was not always the case.\n\n\nAgain, people might be inclined to argue one console is all about playing GAMES, and in that narrow view they are correct, but that doesn't mean their console of choice is better at playing those games. In fact most games play the exact same on both consoles. I know, because I own both, and have seen both systems play the same game in my living room.","c051h8g":"The main thing you want to look at is what *exclusive* titles are on each console. Everyone here is going to paint whatever console they prefer to be God's gift. Each console has it's strength:\n\n* Playstation 3 - Media, graphics, and typically a larger J-RPG library\n* Xbox 360 - Vast game library, well established online community, getting more and more RPG\/J-RPG all the time\n* Wii - Family friendly, girlfriend friendly, console best used in groups of friends\n\nMy Wii collects dust. I don't bother with the PS3. The only three exclusive PS3 games I've been interested in don't justify the cost of the system. In my opinion, the 360 is the best new console for gaming.\n\nA lot of people will talk about how the PS3 can play X video format, can browse the web, let's you install Linux.. I tell these people that I have a computer for all of these tasks. I buy a game console to play video games, and that's that.\n\nHere is a list of console exclusives from about a year ago to give you an idea of where each system lies. This really should be your deciding factor here. Go with the system that has more exclusive games that you enjoy.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.videogamesblogger.com\/2007\/06\/17\/console-exclusive-games-list-for-xbox-360-ps3-and-wii-as-of-june-2007.htm","c051in2":"You can sell your own PC games.

And with the new controller giving 1:1 control, I'm pretty interested, too.\n\nAnd what I really want is a PS3. I want to be able to put shows and movies that I download on it so that we can watch tv without using the computer, I like the idea that is a blu-ray player, and I want to play games like MGS, LittleBigPlanet and SOCOM.

I gave him the controller, and he played for 10 minutes before he quit and handed it back to me... and we were only on the first black ninjas.

A lot of people claim that it needs to be charged because of all the services they add to it.  That's a load of BS.\n\nMost of the online gaming is peer-to-peer and not server-client.  Your online stats are stored on their servers, but the actual gameplay takes place peer-to-peer.\n\nWhat MS and their fanboys are arguing is that the additional perks of the live service make it worth the money.  If that were the case, MS could simply put online gaming on the silver membership and all the \"extras\" on the gold membership.  This would never happen as most people just get it to play online with their friends, the perks are just a bonus but not something worth the money.\n\nMS had a big headstart with their console.  This resulted in a large lead in console penetration in homes.  Since they had the largest install base and they were the first to have an non-pc online service, they could charge for it basically because of its novelty (and most console gamers have really low expectations - if they came from PC, they would have seen the live fee as sacrilege).  When a good online game comes out for both ps3 and xbox, people generally buy the xbox version.  Why?  \n\nis it\n\na) Because most of their friends have an xbox and they want to play online.\n\nb) the xbox gold perks\n\n\nYou know the answer is a.  People get the xbox version because most of their friends have it and they want to play together.  They're willing to continue to eat the LIVE fee because there's no alternative - their friends don't have ps3s.  \n\nAfter they've already paid for it, they need to convince themselves that it was a worthy investment by bringing up all the great things that gold membership offers in addition to just online play.\n\nPC gamers often use STEAM as an example of a good online service with plenty of profiling information, achievements, etc, yet still remaining free.  \n\nWhile all companies are out to make money, companies to MS are CLEARLY just out to make money whereas companies like Valve at least put soul into their products and respect their consumers.\n","c0538a8":"I *sort of* agree, with provision. they will have to give it up eventually.

Just about everything else was context-sensitive and mapped to the L1 and L2 buttons, which, for simplicity's sake, basically correspond to \"up\" and \"down\". Need to jump? L1. Vault over a fence? Run + L1. Climb up a ledge? Walk up to it and press L1 again. Even more complicated moves, like jumping off a building and sliding down a wire to another rooftop, happen automatically as long as you jump in the right direction, and by pressing L2 at the end of the wire, Faith kicks into a slide-stop.\n\nwhich is what I was worried about. However, it goes on to say:\n\n&gt; But if this sounds a little too simple, it's really just the tip of the iceberg. You'll eventually learn complicated combos that will change the way you look at the world: Suddenly an area that once seemed impossible to get to is within your reach. Once you broaden your vocabulary of moves, so to speak, you'll also discover that there are usually multiple ways to get from point A to point B. In fact, Faith's world has been designed so that there are usually multiple paths through a level\n\nwhich isn't really depicted or mentioned in any of the video previews so far.

That's a different day than the rest.\n\nSo, quite a few people look like they had their accounts wiped. Why would they still have their Gamerscore, though?\n\nMost of the people got the achievement on the 9th. The game did not come out on the 9th. It came out on the 6th. Although the 9th was the first Saturday after the game came out. So, it was definitely a very popular day for playing Braid.\n\nWhat I'm thinking is this: Maybe there was a bug recording the completion times on that day, and everyone got the same time. But that doesn't explain all the data. What's up with the guy who got it on the 23rd, with the same time? I'd need to look at more profiles to see if the dates vary. (Joy I Division got all the achievements on 8\/21)\n\nAnother idea: The first guy on the list truly earned it, then he shared his game save. If someone were to install his game save, would it earn them the achievement on the date in the game save (the 9th), or would it earn it on the day they installed the game save on their system? If it's the latter, then that could explain why some that one guy earned the same time at a much later date.\n\nThird option: It could just be a bug, and those people who had their accounts wiped could have been for unrelated reasons. Seems like an awfully large number of people just on this short list I prepared, though.\n\nIt's also very strange that so many people earned every Braid achievement on the same day. I, myself, beat the game on the day I bought it (earning 11 out of 12 achievements), but then I failed the Speed Run by 20 minutes. Is it reasonable to expect the average person to beat the full Speed Run on the same day they bought the game? Or would they need some practice first?\n\nBut some people didn't get them on the same day. If a shared game save was involved, and they already earned most of the achievements themselves, then installed the game save, would it just fill in the remaining achievements on the day the game save was installed?\n\nSo many questions!\n\nEDIT: Since I posted this article, three *more* people have the exact same time.\n\n[Lars Fredrik](http:\/\/live.xbox.com\/en-US\/profile\/profile.aspx?pp=0&amp;GamerTag=Lars+Fredrik) Got the achievements on varied dates.

Cars run faster, longer and cleaner than they do today and scientists are experimenting with ways to use magnetic waves to power the cars full time through lamp posts. \n\nMagnetic waves power converters become commonplace for small devices. Such as the Imovix (A portable player for new release cinema movies streamed directly), wireless earpieces and headphones, internet visors, etc. Neural tech is starting to become commonplace for controlling devices and searching the web, something we would have no hope of understanding but our grandchildren can control in a instant. \n\nNot everyone will live like this however, what we would consider rich today would be poorest standards in a hundred years. Normal HD televisions, 5 ghz machines with 4 gigs of ram, etc. Kids will question how anyone could live with only 3 ghz of speed and only 2 gigs of ram when their machines range into the hundreds.\n\nThe internet will become dramatically better in terms of quality. You tube videos will have at least 2000 and up resolutions, etc. Artists will turn to the internet as the new source of profit, cds will have become completely outdated. All analog formats including dvds will be completely outdated. Instead you buy and download everything on a cable box, game system or computer then view it. You can store it on a external drive or a far outdated DVD future type. \n\nCable boxes\/ dish\/ whatever will become more like computers with much better hardware and features. Game systems like the xbox and wii will become more and more like computers as well except for kids and for those inept in regular computers. Or you can take the alternative program the Microsoft introduced back in 2020 which allows you to play xbox games on your pc, no alternate versions required. \n\nIts important to understand that soon generations will grow up without the need to buy a physical product like a DVD movie or Game disc\/ CD (Its sorta of like that now). They will find such things worthless eventually and everyone will forget that they even existed.\n\nThe internet will make people much smarter than ever before. However not always true. Right now you can say for every truth told on the internet you could look at another place where it is a lie or deep in its own ignorance.

That is of course depends on the first amendment and the internet. Punishments would be light however such as a isp limiting your internet access for some time a couple of hours. Basically the the first amendment does not give you the right to spread misinformation on the internet nor protects you from juvenile antics. To say the very least the government will begin to seek control of groups through the Internets by their own group and will very likely begin to weed out the the most serve of cases first than focus on the little stuff. \n\nEh ill talk about the global library and the political field later or something..,, ","c055xfh":"The mouse-over text speaks the truth!\n\nI just moved in to my new house last thursday and my room mate had forgotten the power cord for his wireless router.

That said, I do have a few comments.\n\n&gt; I can accomplish most tasks faster and easier in windows than my roommates on OSX or Ubuntu can.\n\nEither you're being hyperbolic or your roommates must not be as computer-literate as you are, because I'd expect \"most tasks\" to actually be about the same in every OS. The basic tasks, like web browsing, reading emails, navigating the filesystem, doing word processing, all those are pretty much the same on any OS (although if you're using Windows, I really hope you're not using IE).\n\n&gt; my virus scan updates itself and anti spyware is incorporated into vista\n\nSo you honestly don't mind spending the time and computer resources dealing with anti-virus, even if you personally don't have to do anything? Every time I boot into Windows (which is admittedly rarely), I have to wait a few minutes for everything to update, and even then I usually have to reboot to install a few Windows patches (if I booted into Windows more frequently, I expect I'd have to reboot less frequently, but I'd still have to wait for everything to update first). Every time I boot back into OS X I know I'm ready to go instantly. Additionally, many anti-virus software products have been called (only mildly exaggerated) viruses themselves because of how much computing power and resources they take.\n\n&gt; Drivers are available through windows update\n\nSure, but you don't find it a hassle to have to get them in the first place?\n\n&gt; And aero looks pretty enough for me\n\nAmusingly, Aero was designed by the same visual designer that created OS X's Aqua.\n\n&gt; the VB courses I did just for kicks were pretty easy, tying a database into your app can't realy get any easier than it is in VB.net\n\nThis is pretty tangential now. Debating programming languages is, for the most part, irrelevant to choice of OS.\n\n&gt; Media center is also pretty nice, I can watch all my movies or TV shows right over my network with my xbox 360\n\nI prefer my PS3 for that, because it doesn't have the same fan noise. Although if I'm watching anything I purchased over iTunes, I'll use my Apple TV (yes, I own one, and yes, I like it).\n\n&gt; it's major selling point ISN'T \"it looks pretty\"\n\nNeither is the major selling point for the Mac. The biggest confusion I see in Windows users is they think being user-friendly and \"looking pretty\" are the same thing, and are pointless. But they're wrong. Being user-friendly generally means looking pretty, but the reverse isn't true. And being user-friendly is an extremely important aspect of design. Windows users are taught how to use their computer, Mac users generally just figure it out. Why? Because OS X is user-friendly and discoverable, and Windows is crazy. More than once I've heard a former Windows user talk about how they tried to figure out how to do some task in OS X, and they couldn't get it to work until they told themself \"ok, forget how Windows does it, just do it how it *should* be done\" and it worked. The first time I tried to use Windows I got completely lost because everything that seemed like it should work, didn't, and every time I learned how to do something, it seemed like the most batshit crazy way to do that task. I *still* haven't figured out how to put something in the start menu without opening up the folder in Windows Explorer and messing with shortcuts there.\n\nIf you're happy with Windows, then by all means stick with it. I'm not going to force you to buy a new computer and throw out all your old software just because I think OS X is better in general. But I still don't understand why you hate Macs so much.","c05cyhs":"Hmmpf, as an xbox 360 owner I have to admit I've bought more XB Live Arcade games in the last couple of months than I have full games.

A sort of 3d-platform meets wii tennis, meets wii fit..\n\nThe funny thing is .. a lot of games could be like that, if only they made the controls work like they should. But somehow a lot of companies are stuck in their translate-motion-into-button-press. Hence all the waggling.\n\nI gues you can invent a new controller and all, but balancing controls, gameplay and story is something only few people are capable of doing. The rest of the industry just follows.\n\nRemember back in the days where they were figuring out the controls for 3d FPS on the PC? Remember the transition from keyboard to keyboard &amp; mouse? There were a lot of failed games in between... that just didn't get it right. That whole WASD meme comes from this era as well.\n\nNow, think about the transition of 3d FPS to controllers. It was Goldeneye for the N64 that got it right. That control setup is still used for all the new ps3 and xbox 360 games...\n\nPoint is, with new controls the developers need to reinvent the game genre's and control schematics .. This also involves gameplay a lot; jumping and timing puzzles are a lot of fun when you are only pressing buttons, but when you introduce some analog axis .. gameplay involving reflexes and aiming start being more fun. \n\nIt no wonder we are seeing so many horror games for the Wii in 2009. Reflex- and aim- based gameplay fit the horror genre nicely and there are some proven control setups that work (see also RE4) ..\n\nI also believe that after Metroid Prime 3, we will see that, control-wise, the Wii works best for FPS. Esspecially when you add some environmental interaction.. \n\nWhat they need to figure out though is that when possible the Wiimote should be used to control the camera .. until you hold a button to enter aim\/shoot\/hit mode .. \n\nThe point is, until somebody does it right and shows the rest of the industry how it's done, we are going to see a lot of games with less than pleasant controls. It gets worse when the games are ports and weren't designed with those controls in mind in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","c05d7p6":"I bought the arcade bundle.

What does Linux\/Windows have as major advantages over Apple machines (keeping in mind that you could install either on the hardware)?\n\n\nYou do realize that you're the \"anti-apple fanboy,\" right?

MS can pump up the Xbox any time it wants especially since it uses less customized hardware. \n\nThe only real weakness is the longevity of the box. But at 200 bucks people aren't going to care much I don't think. If I was MS I'd sell a full blown OS on these things. \n\nThey need more key hyped up titles, but in the big scale of thing Xbox is a better idea, vastly less money and easier to keep up to date for MS. \n\nSony MUST embrace the PC\/Console model or get left in the dust title wise. Homebrew is JUST starting to really take off now, so that effect is only going to help Xbox more most likely. \n\nI think Xbox's continued dominance is a sure sign it's winning the console war. It's a year older console and not as aggressively aimed at performance. The kicker is updating it isn't going to cost MS a bunch of money like Sony's PS4 will cost. They could throw in a dual core and top of the line graphics today cheaper than ever. The PC hardware market is killing performance wise but the cross over to dual and quad CPU's takes time. \n\nI think the biggest thing holder back the PC is that it's not using it's hardware versatility for much else beside video cards. \n\nWhere is the PC hardware versatility when it comes to interface. MS needs to ramp up some vision of new interfaces and throw in some API's and just push the market is directions it may not believe there are demand for.\n\nI think with the consolidation of the PC market we see less hardware diversity and innovation, taking away the PC's biggest advantage. BUT, I expect this will naturally change over time and the PC will remain a powerhouse while console like Xbox and PS4 bring the console market to the PC along with time bringing lower and lower prices, but nothing like what MS can bring with the xbox as far as real bang for the buck.\n\nSay the Xbox sags in sales and MS has no spellable alternative, they can always consolidate their platform as I said, they have a lot of flexibility that no other console currently has.\n\nI imagine these cross over console running full fledged desktop OS, but customized to run on TVs, offering the full PC experience (beside high resolution) for dirt cheap. The biggest problem with PC gaming is obviously the cost of the hardware.\n\nFor hardware gamers though, the selection of good looking games is mind blowing compares to the few Xbox and PS4 titles. PC does little to market their games and the cost of their hardware platform cost too much. Xbox has more or less solved all that but it's MS so it's a bad thing right ?\n\n\n\n\n\n","c05f70z":"From my experience(playing FIFA on the xbox) its pretty much the easiest outside the PK box shot from right there, something that has been done thousands of times and generally considered a sure thing.","c05f8v1":"I'm sure that the number of people buying a game for multiple platforms is very low so they're not losing any sales by including everything in one package (except the cost of media which is essentially zero.)

Back in the hayday of the original xbox, I had a 2 game gamefly account, which was absolutely great.  Games were very frequently available, and the results were a system that handled your queue very similarly to netflix.  It started at the top, and worked it's way down.  Occasionally they wouldn't have a game available, but it was definately not the norm.  I had the account for just over a year, and eventually cancelled it when I purchased my house, and was cutting back on expenses.  When I finally got my xbox360 earlier this year, I found myself renting quite a bit again, and decided to give gamefly another go.  This time, it was a totally different experience.  I setup a queue of 10 games or so, with gears of war at the top of the list.  All of the games listed as available, and gears, being a release title, seemed like a reasonable request.  When the first orange envelope arrived in my mailbox, I excitedly opened it, and was only slightly dissapointed to find the 7th game on my list in there.  No big deal..I wanted to play all of them, so I fired up my xbox and threw in the game.  It wouldn't play.  as I pulled it out and looked at it...it was pretty much demolished.  It wasn't a scratch here and a scratch there.  It was COVERED in scratches.  I sent it back to them, and they sent me another copy of the game, which worked, but the service kept going down hill.  Turn around times varied wildly, which I understand can at times be the fault of the post office, rather than gamefly, but I continued to recieve only the games at the bottom of my list.  No, I didn't put 1 or 2 games in my list, because that's not the way the system is built to work, and that's not the way it should have to be used.  Though now that I see more and more people saying that, I wonder if that's not a big part of the problem for the people using the queue correctly.  There are so many people exploiting the 1 to 2 game queue idea that those who maintain a larger queue never have a chance to get the games they want.  Either way, after a few months, I cancelled my account, and have just given my business to the local video store.  After slow turn around times (be they gamefly's fault or not)...I'm actually saving money this way.  I have seen both sides of gamefly, and can totally agree with the author that it can be a totally broken, and dissapointing system.

I was like, \"dude, I saw one episode where they had to beat a video game to get at some data that was hidden on an xbox.\"\n\nThey looked at me like *I* was stupid. \"so?\"\n\nI'm sure when they got the IP, it was something like 69.954.2335.RAM.","c05qks4":"[Whimsy](http:\/\/incise.org\/whimsy.html) - a Python window manager.  I make the code available but as far as I know, I'm the only one using it (for a good while now -- a year or two?), and I created it because I wanted a WM that was *exactly* what I wanted it to be. (other WMs come close but I was always frustrated about something or another)\n\nIn the past few days I've created a little emulator \"frontend\" in Python so I can play old video games all within a consistent interface.  It's basically just a full screen menu that lists games and launches emulators and is controlled by a joystick.  I used Python, PyGame, and the simple-python-gui library.  I made it because I enjoyed the interface on hacked xboxes.\n\nI also have what seems like a billion utility scripts, aborted projects, etc. I wrote a script that sets ID3 tags on files based on their filenames and directory names and use it a lot.  It even remembers file modification times so that it doesn't needlessly read through thousands of MP3s -- this makes it very fast to run it on my whole collection, when relatively few files need updating.\n\nThe other day I made a script to make the apt-cache search\/apt-get install dance less typing-intensive.  It searches for some terms, gives you a list of matching packages, and you can give it a list of which to install (by number).  Pretty trivial though.  And it'd probably be just as easy to use one of the GUI programs, but I like the command line.","c05qlkn":"Nope - just the licensing and all the millions of subscribers and micro transactions on xbox live.","c05qpko":"My little brother, who is now in high school and owns an xbox 360, has been known to pull out my old N64 to play goldeneye with his friends. That game was \"cool\" when I was in middle school! \n\nOf course there have been works of absolute genius in recent years. The orange box for example. There is something big to be said, however, for the fact that even the youngest of kids these days recognize the greatness in something like Super Mario for NES. \n\nI believe it's a similar reason that people can get so addicted to simple flash games. Often I find a very basic game to be much more entertaining than the newest most complex games with pretty graphics. When working within very limited boundaries I think it forces creativity and a simplicity which ends up being beneficial. \n\nAs I said even my little brother recognizes this fact. He loves his new-ish 360 but ends up just renting the newest games for it and then what does he go back and play consistently? All my old games from when I was young(er). \n\nThis also explains a lot of the success of the DS. It's a relatively simple platform, and yet it's SO GOOD!","c05qu9h":"Right - in japan, where the xbox had always been in 3rd place and barely sold at all.

D\/l all the classics and you have hours upon hours of free games. I can't tell you how much time I spent playing Tetris and Dr. Mario against my friends. You can also d\/l movies to play on the modded console on your TV.\n\n**Drinking** Make sure everyone chips in or you have some sort of system with your friends to rotate who is buying. Don't be the guy(me :( ) who buys Guiness when everyone else buys keystone. They'll just mooch your nice beer and repay you with key or pbr. (NO! 3 cans of pbr !=1 can Guiness) If you do like nice beer\/alcohol, get your own mini-fridge, preferably one you can lock.\n\n**Dates:** Avoid the movies, dinners or clubs, put a little more effort into it and they'll think you are romantic, plus it ends up being cheaper. Make a picnic for the zoo or the park, or even your dorm room. Go for a walk, just talking with her to get to know her. Sounds dorky, but they love it.\n\n**Transportation:** There's rarely anything worth going to that isn't within biking distance of campus. Invest in a good lock. Bum rides if you have to.\n\n**Money making:** Volunteer to collect all the cans\/bottles from parties. Recycle them.\n\n**General advice:** get as much free stuff from campus events as you can. Shirts, condoms, pens, deodorant, towels, shampoo, and of course **food.** \n\nFinally, **DO NOT GET A CREDIT CARD** It might be convenient now, but when you have $15,000 of credit card debt later, on top of your student loans, you will be living on ramen even after you graduate.","c05rhs8":"Please provide evidence of people working in the USA against their will.

The only reason hd-dvd was even a contender was because MS was egging on Toshiba (look it up).\r\n\r\nThe iPod still has a 75% share of the market. The Zune, if it is secceeding at all, is merely chipping away at competitors of the iPod. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't care for Microsoft's business ethics, and quality. It's second-rate software sold for premium prices (well, now at least).

Because no one would want an open PC game.  I wouldn't ever buy an open PC game.

If you run the same title on a low-end PC vs. a high-end model, you\u2019ll likely think you\u2019re playing two different games, so significant is the difference.\n\nWell, this is only half-true, PC games are made, generally, for mid-to-midupper level systems, with some ability to degrade to lower specs.\n\nThe problem with this theory as applied to the xbox is simple - it would mean designing games for the new system, but then releasing them as xbox 360 games, and that isn't going to be a viable option to developers\/publishers until the new system is available, otherwise it's just increasing development costs, and potentially causing harm to the game's performace on the current system, for some nebulous date in the future when it might look better. But if you're doing that, you might as well just in-house develop with the better system in mind, and ship a 'stripped down' xbox 360 version that may very well run better than the 'combined' version. Plus, at the point in the future when the new system is out, you release the 'full' quality version, and the public maybe buy it again.\n\nAlso, PC games are rarely made with 'better than current' systems in mind, the only game that springs to mind is Crysis, which was generally laughed at for that fact.\n\nThe only other options are to 'automatically' improve the visual quality somehow, but that really boils down to 2 methods, you either increase the resolution, or 'improve' the textures somehow.\n\nIncreasing the resolution isn't really going to be an option for MS, the xbox 360 already supports 1080p (either via HDMI on the newer models, or via VGA). HDTV isn't going to progress beyond 1080p in the next 2-3 years, XDTV is on the horizon in japan, but it's a long way from being something worth supporting, and it's likely to change before a specification is final, so it's not a good idea for MS.\n\nThat leaves us with increasing texture quality somehow. The usual trick is to use better filtering of the textures. Well, the thing is, the backwards-compatibility on the 360 already does this. It's also not a ground breaking difference, it DID make a difference between the PS and PS2 generation, because texture quality was awful prior to that. But it's not a HUGE jump from xbox to 360, and it's going to be less of a jump from 360 to 'whatever'.\n\nThere are potential 'future technologies' that could perhaps allow this sort of 'forward compatibility', such as procedural vertex and texture generation, but they are not common place now, they may allow the next system to transition to the system after it with an automatic and major increase in quality, but they are not here now and will not be offering any benefits to the current-&gt;next generation jump.","c05yt71":"I've procrastinated my whole life and have accomplished very little for a meaningful career and education.

UI screens also suffer since console players just navigate them with a gamepad.  Of course, developers could do a separate UI for the PC, but most are too lazy.  (Oblivion, Deus Ex 2, etc)  Difficulty is often wrong on the PC also because the controls are so much more accurate.\n\nI'd love it if mouse+keypad controls were standard on a console.  It'd be much cheaper to buy an xbox once every couple years, and there are certainly fewer problems with bugs due to standardized hardware.

You have cards, but since you can only have 3 and you draw back up to 3 every turn, you are pretty much constantly using whatever you got instead of waiting for some strategic use of the card.\n\nOn the other hand hand, the zombie miniatures are pretty cool and the cards have nice art.

Such a difference in response can only happen when one party severely does not understand how important something is to the other.\n\nI'm sure he tried to tell them.

Notice how they originally thought he intended to go live with one of his online friends?  He had no more local friends, xbox live was his entire social life.  Rather than try to deal with the problem that was causing him to want to spend his time online, they just wanted to take the easy way out and punish him and take away his method of coping with the problem.","c067j66":"they should make an xbox game out of this...","c067jyw":"xboxlive, i believe.","c067lqy":"Me too!\nWhat a game...

The computer was all I had.\n\n I remember lying to my mom that my girlfriend was a friend of a friend. She would have flipped if she knew I actually met a girl on the Internet.

I have yet to see the PSN work the day of a popular game release","c06e1r8":"Don't convert them back to DVD as jetjaguar said, it will result in a loss of quality.\n\nI'd recommend using your s-video cables.\n\nIf you're honestly worried about quality that much, you should download movies in ISO or Bin&amp;cue file format and burn them directly to DVD; buy yourself a LCD tv that has a PC-video input (highly recommend LG tv's for that); or buy an xbox360 so you can stream Xvid\/Divx to your TV through HMDI cables.","c06e365":"The laptop has mac-style keys.

But for every xbox you buy, for every case of beer, for every book, you are depriving someone of clean water and food.\n\nBut, hey you worked hard for that xbox, right?  That's your money.  But you should also get free health care that you don't pay for on top of this.\n\n","c06e7mi":"That's true, but the ratios are still variable.  For example, Slashdot has a much lower ratio of idiots that Reddit.  Like MMA, the reasons are cultural.

","c06ea6r":"a lot of those morons are legitimately poor.\n\nwith it freely available on the internet with no DRM, do you really expect them to just not play the game at all when gaming is one of the few things to keep yourself from spiraling into deep depression because you live in small suburban shit-town America with no public transit, you don't own a car, you're slightly too intelligent to enjoy what's on the free television stations you have access to, and you're already only on the internet because your neighbor is too stupid to lock up their wireless connection.\n\nSeriously, maybe I'm a big fat *jerk*, but I and many people I know fall into this category.  We're fairly intelligent but we didn't go to college and don't have the skills to land us a high paying job in just any industry without working in said industry for ten years and the current job climate doesn't lend itself to allowing that to happen much (I literally just went through downsizing, half the staff was laid off, me included.  I had only been there a year.  Now I'll get a new job with either the same starting pay or less.  Yeah, that makes life REAL easy.).\n\nWe don't go to the doctor because we can't afford it, we don't go out to bars because we can't afford it, and we don't go to theaters because we can't afford it.\n\nSince we already don't have enough money for health care or to be able to go out in public and afford to do social activities outside of our apartments\/houses, most of us honestly don't feel like we should be wasting money on music\/movies\/video games.\n\nOccasionally we will, but those of us who do are a lot more picky about what we spend our money on.  Some of us (like myself) will wait years to be able to buy a next-gen console on the cheap.  I just got a used xbox360 for $100.  First time I've spent money on a console since a PS2 in 2003 (which I eventually sold because I never played it anymore.).  I only have ONE game: Fallout 3.  When do I plan on buying another game?  Good question, probably not for quite a while.  I have a track record of only buying 3-4 games for any console I own during the time I own it.  Because buying games that I end up not playing because they are shitty _is a god damned waste of money I don't have._\n\nWe never got credit cards because we saw that that did to our parents.  Those of us who *did* go to college often have huge amounts of student loans.\n\nPeople may really only be freaking out about the financial crisis *now*, but there is a large population that already lived from paycheck to paycheck who were definitely swayed by the obsessive over-indulgent advertising that literally accosts us every fucking day at every fucking turn.\n\nAdvertising is built to make you have a near manic desire for things you *don't need.*\n\nSo you tell me, when you build something like the internet, make it so you can infinitely reproduce products like music, movies, and video games at *no cost,* and have instilled upon a population that they *absolutely must have these products* but they honestly *do not have the money for said products,* do you think its unreasonable for them to turn to piracy?\n\nI'm not trying to advocate piracy here, but you people have to stop bitching like the people who pirate shit live fucking extravagant lifestyles or some shit and are just ripping people off because they *can.*\n\nSome of us really do live in shit towns, where we're too smart to deal with half the fucking rednecks who surround us (effectively killing our social lives), make too little to be able to entertain ourselves reasonably, and have turned to the internet to solve that problem.\n\nYes, maybe those people should just go to the library, read a few books, and start a blog.  That's definitely more constructive, but the issue is this: it's not happening, and we have rampant advertising bombarding these people everyday with the *specific purpose* of making them *want* to have these things they don't need and literally cannot afford.  Something like 80% of psychology graduates go into advertising.  Gee, *no wonder* advertising is so effective at making people want shit they don't need and can't afford.\n\nDon't act like the companies aren't asking for it with overblown and unnecessary advertising coupled with a distribution platform that allows limitless copies at no cost whatsoever.\n\nWhich is a smarter solution for a modern poor American?  Get a credit card and pay for games with money you don't have and dig yourself a fucking hole until you have to file for bankruptcy OR pirate it.\n\nThere *is* no easy solution, and at the moment, we just have to deal with the fact that such items are essentially de-valued in our economy.  People are unwilling to pay for them because they are unnecessary, but they still *want* them, so they steal them.  Simple as that. \n\nEDIT:  Also this:\n&gt;DRM issues and \"I should be able to know if the game is good or not\" are just excuses to make yourself feel better about not paying for someone else's hard work.\n\nYou don't think the piraters have fucking jobs and work hard, you douchey motherfucker?  Do you think they don't do backbreaking manual blue collar labor for fucking shitty ass minimum fucking wage that's essentially just enough to live paycheck to paycheck due to inflation?  And you know what else?  Some of them don't do manual labor, some of them do the most fucking UNAPPRECIATED JOB IN THIS COUNTRY.  That's right they're fucking TEACHERS.  Because they give half of a shit about the education of the future of our nation, they get paid dick all and can't afford jack shit.

But now, almost every game is available online, what's the point? \n\nIt's sad, because I love going to arcades, but really, they are dumps or overpriced now. The decent ones never have any good games anymore either. :(","c06ecwa":"not surprised, isn't the \"new xbox experience\" due right around now? a couple weeks ago or so the dashboard said \"13 days til NXE\". im definitely excited for 2-8 way private chats so my friends and i can talk without the adolescents and rednecks.","c06ed1t":"I wasn't trying to insinuate I was entitled to anything.\n\nAs for the teachers, the three I know personally all pirate games.

This whole year.  All of 2008.  That's the ONE thing I've spent extra money on.\n\nThe computer I have has been cobbled together from random parts I've either bought extremely used over time or have parted out from other computers that the various places I have worked for were throwing away.  If you want specs, here:  Athlon XP 1ghz with 786mb of SDRAM and an nvidia geforce 4400 Ti.  Other than the motherboard and the case, I didn't pay for any of that, it was scavenged parts.\n\nAlso, I *do* feel empathy for the people who made World of Goo.  They're not bad people, but I don't feel empathy for people who lump every pirate into some sort of \"well they should have more respect blah blah blah.\"  I even said I wasn't saying pirating was a *good* thing, but it's something that happens, and because of the ability to reproduce games infinitely for free over the internet they have been de-valued.\n\nIf you read my follow-up response you'd see that I genuinely do hope for the best for 2dboy.  World of Goo isn't my cup of tea, but I'm glad they're out there doing it and I *do* wish they were selling more copies.  I never intended to make it sound like I thought they haven't worked hard, they have.  But other people in this country work hard too, and a lot of them have their work \"disrespected\" by their own bosses who would rather fuck their employees than take a pay cut.\n\nAnyway, as I said in my follow-up, the reasons I stated don't make pirating *right,* but they *are* reasons that it happens regardless.  I don't care that you don't have unfounded statistics, because you are correct, there's a large portion of people who pirate it that *do genuinely have the money for it.*\n\nPlease excuse my earlier rant because I'm tired of vague generalizations being made for people who pirate.  It *was* a broad generalization in itself about piracy and *not* directed specifically at the World of Goo game.  It was meant to refer to piracy as a whole, not just for one game.\n\nAnd seriously, I only did name calling once.  In fact, that ending bit was the *only* bit directed at you.  Because I kind of felt what you said was bullshit, because a *lot* of people work hard, not just the people who make games.  The rest of it was meant in general for people who rip on piraters.\n\nUpvoted your response regardless of disagreement.","c06ek2e":"Actually, I was just being a dick.

It's not an accident the dominant colour in MGS4 is a sort of yellow to convey a sort of almost dream like interpretation of the middle east.\n\nIn Farcry 2 brown is the look, it does a good job of conveying a sweaty hot atmosphere, even though when you look at photographs of africa you find despite it being hot the photographs do not convey it the way the game does.\n\nYou can see for yourself here: http:\/\/recensioni-videogiochi.dvd.it\/images\/Far_Cry_2\/far-cry-2-03-l.jpg\n\nIf they were going for photo realism there's no way they would have played out the lighting the way they did or added the overall brown tinge to the look.\n\nIf GTA4 was going for photorealism this is what it would look like: http:\/\/www.joystiq.com\/media\/2006\/07\/gta4fake.jpg instead this is what it looks like: http:\/\/ps3media.ign.com\/ps3\/image\/article\/866\/866055\/grand-theft-auto-iv-20080411005544028.jpg\n\nThe colours are a lot more saturated and contrast more sharply than they would in real life. Last gens GTA games were a lot more cartoony looking, again it was more or less delibrate to convey a more, well, cartoony feel.\n\nMGS4 is an extremely yellow game, there's no other word to describe it really.\n\nAnother example would be Gears of War 2, cliff bleszinski himself said it was rendered in a stylized way and really you could argue it looks much more 'photorealistic' than any other game this gen http:\/\/media.teamxbox.com\/games\/ss\/1863\/1191473643.jpg\n\n\nIf you've seen the FFXIII and FFXIII versus trailer you'll get the best demonstration of how stylistic rendering plays out in games, Versus is supposed to be a darker game and this reflects completely in its art. Sure its graphics look 'realistic', but so does FFXIII look realistic, but in both cases it's clear the art is not goign for photorealism, it's going for style. ersus' colour pallet is a lot more bland than FFXIII's: http:\/\/www.megatonnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/07\/final-fantasy-xiii-xbox-360.jpg  http:\/\/cache.kotaku.com\/assets\/resources\/2008\/02\/ffxiiiscan.jpg","6yi2":"it's pretty simple, really.\n\n360 = 200$ backwards compatible with xbox games\nWii = 250$ backwards compatible with gamecube games\nPS3 = 300$ (is the 300$ model still for sale?) with ***NO*** backwards compatibility with PS2 games\n\nanyone with a fair sized collection of either xbox or GC games, will want a console that allows them to go back and finish those old games they never got around to finishing while they wait to buy new gen console games.\n\nanyone with a collection of PS2 games, is just SoL.","6yj7":"I was watching Life last night and he spilled some drink on his keyboard causing the screen to go all distorted and wobbly.

You were talking about xbox LIVE earlier; you know how many participants still live at home with mom and dad. Microsoft is making up the ground they never gained by selling you an OS and MS Office. The novelty of DLC on a console still hasn't worn off and won't wear off until it's on every console for free. MS is capitalizing on that novelty when they don't necessarily need to be.\nThe 360 is also handy for someone like me who uses computers during my whole nine-hour shift and just wants to game when he comes home. The DLC price makes up for itself in convenience (in my eyes) because I don't have to own a computer to get some cool stuff in my game.

But if you ever want to one day stop being the nice guy, you need to work out.  I'm not saying go to a gym, because you guys will probably feel very out of place as it is not a warcraft costume party.

You guys may be failures when it comes to real life, but just think that it is a video game, and getting a girl means you have reached level 100 as a mana mage!  \n\n2) Eye Contact\n\nAll of you nerds are scared of making eye contact.  I know that.  As an alpha male, I am the 20% of men that 80% of the women go for.  I am 6'1, 175 lbs, dark haired, built, sexy eyes, lips, whatever, the whole package.  Therefore, eye contact is very easy for me, because I know what I bring to the table.  You, the nice guy, on the other hand, are probably very insecure about yourself, whether it is your BO, your fatfuckness, your baldness, ugly non-symmetrical face, the list goes on right?  But let me tell you something.  When you talk to a chick (if you ever get that chance), you NEED to look 'em in the eye.  You guys are used to just looking away when you talk, hoping the girl won't see you as if you put on your invisible sunglasses or some shit.  Newflash:  Girls can see you even when you're not looking at them.  Not making eye contact just means you lack self-confidence, low self-esteem, insecure, very unmanly.  Therefore, whatever you do, look the girl in the eye when you talk.  Not like a fucking stalker creep look, but just a, \"You're very beautiful\" look.  Make the girl believe that she is hot.","c06mc0s":"??? PS3 is way more expensive. 360's are 250-350.

They banged on long enough about how *they* were going to outsell the wii pre-launch.\n\n&gt;developers aren't really wondering if they should put their new first person shooter on the Wii or 360\n\nOf course they are!  The wii is the dominant system in this generations console race.  You mean things like MSG and GoW etc, but they were always tied to the PS or XBox anyway.  The neutral developers are absolutley *not* turning their backs on the wii becasuse it has less graphical capability.  Most games released, independently from the consoles, are cross platform, incorporating the wii.\n\nYour post reads like you consider the Xbox\/PS3 superiour or somehow default winners in this race because the wii could never play Halo or GTA.  This is the whole point here.  The market has shown that people were fed up of [generic shooter][version number +1] and so have flocked to the system that offered something different.  Gears of war does absolutley *nothing* new, Mario Galaxy does.\n\nYour last paragraph about money is just astroturfing.  Microsoft has sold their console at a loss for the majority of its lifetime and I don't think the average wii gamer spends less on acessories than the average 360 gamer.  At least Nintendo made a profit on their console, from the start.\n\n&gt;all while the average Wii owner doesn't spend more than a few hundred dollars for the initial investment. \n\nnonsense.\n\nPosts like yours, and others I've read here, annoy me.

Their systems arent as powerful or as adaptable as a PC, and dont offer anything new like the Wii.\n\nNintendo deserves every credit in this race, they had the foresight to see most people were fed up of incremental graphic increases with the same gameplay.

The storage problem is annoying, but if anything maybe they didnt have the foresight to see how pouular their console would become!  They at least had the forseight to try a diferent path from the gamecube and do something new.

The best kind of satisfaction I have from games is the kind where you can actually *feel* that you're getting better, or figuring out a system. Examples of this would be Ninja Gaiden (xbox), or, perhaps more approriate, the horribly difficult-but-oddly-enjoyable Ikaruga game. \n\nSecond, the addition of all sorts of power-ups would decrease the non-random nature, so this would have to be implemented sparingly.\n\nI'd say the biggest challenge in polishing the gameplay of this is to not just add powerups, use this admittedly great concept, and 'simply' ramp up difficulty.

I tried to quit games cold turkey, but that wasn't the answer.  Now, I live a pretty normal life and I enjoy a mix of xbox live and pc gaming.  I'm looking forward to Diablo 3, especially.  I play games like Rock Band 2, Left 4 Dead, plus some old classics on xbox live like Bomberman and Streets of Rage 2.  Try to find a game that doesn't resemble a full-time job.

It's another case of a person who thinks that their point of view is the only valid way to do things.\r\n\r\nSome of us don't use windows for example. I'll let that sink in for a bit.\r\n\r\nSo, I have a mac for example, for me a gaming pc would basically be a console, since I would only use it to play games.\r\n\r\nOh and regarding factoring in the price of HDTV, I don't see the guy factoring in the price of a monitor, last I checked they arent' free. And here's another thought, maybe I already had an HDTV, because it's not specific to the console, maybe I watch *ghasp* TV shows on it.\r\n\r\nNow, to the point about controls. Who cares? If everybody uses the same controls, what difference does it make that mouse\/kb is better in fps games? What about platformer games like God of War, or Prince of Persia, or driving sims like gt, or fighting games like Soulcalibur where the controller is far better.\r\n\r\nJust because you only play one type of game, doesn't mean your control scheme is the best in town.\r\n\r\nAnd what about the social aspect, I have friends over we sit on a couch play some soulcalibur. PC, not so good for that. \r\n\r\nAnd then we always have a FUD argument about graphics. Well, here's some news for you, you NEED the higher graphics on the pc. You know why? Because you're sitting much closer to the screen. Here's the reality of the situation http:\/\/www.foxav.net\/assets\/images\/resolution_chart.png\r\n\r\nSo yeah, the console runs at lower res, but you're also sitting much further from the screen, end result is that console games look quite nice compared to pc games. And you get the big screen experience to boot, quite cinematic.\r\n\r\nHere's the other thing people don't realize, because console is well a console, it's locked specs. So developers are able to optimize for those specs and the games constantly improve visually throughout the life of the console, and cost to me as the customer, nothing. That's right I don't have to go out and buy a new video card every time a new generation game comes out.\r\n\r\nAnd consoles dying? seriously? well, maybe if you were a sucker and bought a 360, for PS3 and WII, well turns out it's pretty low.\r\n\r\n\u201cFailure rates for all other consoles were not high enough for EB to consider revising their policies.

Every xbox exclusive from Halo to GTAIV(DLC) to Gears of War has been on the hype train. And the suckers just eat it up.

","c06vgkw":"I am one of those xbox 360 users, but I might be different from what you're complaining about. I know that I bought my xbox360 because I wanted to play COD4 online against a huge community. Xboxlive delivered this, and since I have terrific internet and xbox's don't vary in quality I knew that I would be at least on a level playing field.\n\n I do not have a gaming computer, and the price of the xbox was cheaper than buying a top end gaming computer, not to mention the xbox will stay a viable playing option for 3 or 4 years, and will be able to play many different games, once again, without a need to constantly upgrade. \n\nI do, however, regret purchasing GTAIV and I haven't purchased Halo or Gears, so I might not be who you are bitching about. I have, though, logged 16 days on COD4 since last February, and have gotten full use out of that and my live subscription. Oh, and the countless hours of fun my friends and I got on Rockband were well worth the price of the xbox + rockband bundle. ","c06vhmj":"Maybe this comment posted below the photos offers some Greek insight. The guy is rather dramatic and he ends up contradicting himself, but since reddit has been asking for Greeks' opinions these days...here it is.  It's comment no.389:\n\nOkay first please stop turning this into a USA vs Europe bashing because it's banal and irrelevant. Also stop criticising and generalising and bashing the Greeks from the pictures you see, because the fact is that you're asking criticism on something that you don't know or understand.\nSome more facts:\n-The boy was ASSASSINATED, there was no petrol bomb, no anarchists, no riots, no nothing, just some f****tard cop with problems at home drew his gun and shot at a bunch of children because he thought he could get away with it.\n\n-No burning cars and breaking small businesses won't make the country better DIRECTLY, but like someone else pointed out earlier all great changes in history have been achieved through riots and war. It's very easy to say \"stupid bastards are burning cars bla bla bla\" but this reveals nothing but ignorance about the world we live in, as well as the history behind it. Just because you live in a rich country and you have food on your table everyday, and maybe a computer, a house, tv and xbox 360 it doesn't mean the whole world is like this, nor that you were chosen by god to be in such a privileged position because you're better than the rest of the world. The fact is that you belong to the tiny minority of the world's population that lives like this, the majority of the world faces starvation, poverty, illnesses, war and lack of freedom. The fact that you are in such a privileged position today is because your ancestors FOUGHT for it. So if you don't understand rioting and protest then at least respect your own ancestors who died so that you can be rich and play on your xbox today.\n\n-And yeah, no normal person is happy with seeing a car or a small business getting burned down, but protestors\/anarchist does NOT equal to vandals. The vandals are but a small minority of the people who protest, and in many cases they are undercover pigs\/cops. So again this is much more complicated than you think.\n\n-Finally, everything that goes on is a REVOLT against a CORRUPT government and system which has been drinking our blood, and raping us for years and years. Frankly I don't give a f**** about those banks and big businesses getting smashed up, they have sucked so much of our blood so it's practically us who is paying their insurance who is paying the damage. You see what the banks did to the US and world economy, how can you have sympathy for those thieves, and like Pavlos Sidiropoulos said it \"[they are] full of millions while even God was starving\". The death of Grigoropoulos was the damn cherry on the cake, we can't stand this anymore and we've been apathic for too damn long, they steal us, they rape us, they drain our blood like vampires and now they're slaughtering our children in cold blood?! NO! We're not gonna take it, we're not gonna bend over to let them rape us naymore! We want a change and we want it now and we want all those corrupt useless pigs out of the government. We want JUSTICE!\n\n Posted by Asimos December 17, 08 12:17 AM\n\n\nAlso, I for one, would like to say that these photos by Boston are one of the finest examples of high class photojournalism.

I guarentee you with most people if they would have bought a 5year old car instead of brand spanking new ones, and they would have not bought 3 tv's and pay $100\/month for cable then they wouldn't be up to their eyes in debt.  How many people do you know who are in massive debt, and yet those people have bigger houses then all their friends, or a ton of toys... xbox, wii, pool table, etc...\n\nPeople consume when they don't have the money, carry $10k in debt... they get laid off and then say that's why they're in debt.\n\nLoad of crap... I do believe some people have debt because they simply can't afford to live in a crappy apartment and feed themselves, but most people that are in debt are living above their means.","c06vpoo":"So the answer is, clearly you are responsible enough to handle a credit card.  Get one that offers rewards.. The Chase Freedom card is 1% back on all purchases and 3% back on the categories you spend the most in.  I earn a few hundred bucks a year in rewards that way, and my credit rating is very high as a result.\n\nJust HAVING the credit card can help your credit rating, even if you don't use it much, and it's a good thing to have in case of financial emergency.  But either way, you should use it when you can, if for nothing other than your regular monthly cable bill, netflix, tivo, xbox live, whatever you'd normally pay every month, now you just have to pay one bill instead of all those and you're improving your credit in the process.","c06vt5a":"[Port it to XNA](http:\/\/creators.xna.com\/en-US\/) and put it on [Xbox 360 LIVE Community Games.](http:\/\/marketplace.xbox.com\/en-US\/games\/catalog.aspx?d=7)\r\n\r\nYou can sell it on LIVE and release it freely to PC users.","c06vvll":"so if i use xlink kai, am i playing with people on xbox live?\n\nin the faq it only specifies that it enables play over a LAN or system link. whats the point of that?","c06vvnb":"this is why I have a PC... and for every 360 game, there is an alternative and good PS3 or PC game. both are nice systems, but Xbox (both original and 360) turned out just the way I always expected... while there are SOME exclusive games, there are not as many as there used to be. the very fact that 1. xbox games are built around a windows based platform, they lend themselves to being easily ported to PC. examples:\n1. fable (original) released with expanded content on the PC\n2. Halo 1,2 released on PC after being advertised as Xbox \"exclusive\"\n3. Left 4 Dead is already on PC\n4. Mass Effect is not exclusive to 360\nHalo 3, Fable 2, Mass Effect 2 are all very likely to show up on PC as well, probably with one or all having expanded content, and\/or less bugs, etc.\n\nThat said, it would be nice to have a 360, but I can only afford my PC and PS3 so I'll be happy with my choice. \n\nNote, if you will the options listed in this competing and also accurate article:\nhttp:\/\/www.thegamereviews.com\/article-598-Top-5-PS3-Games-That-360-Fanboys-Wish-They-Had.html\n\nyou will see that fewer PS3 games get ports to other systems (due to development costs and time). \n\nSo it all depends on how a person wants to spend their money and time, but for my money, a PC and PS3 are the way to go... obviously that won't work for everyone, but there is gaming

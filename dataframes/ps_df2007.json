cheaper to get a decent computer, a Wii, and a Playstation 3 than it was to get a gaming desktop that could compete with a playstation 3. \r\n\r\nPlus, you can get a keyboard and mouse for the first person shooters on the PS3 (or so I've heard) so you're not even losing that. \r\n\r\nOf course, there's no WoW. Maybe Linux next year?","cykw9":"Who would want a PS3 though? I don't, they are not that impressive to me, I do want a Wii, but I don't see it replacing PC games, simply complimenting them. It's also not about cost (I can easily afford a gaming computer, wii, xbox360, ps3 and have plenty money to spare for another computer) but rather it's the utility. I see no point in booting into another operating system simply so I can surf the web, program or chat to my friends\/family on msn\/icq (which are my main activities on a computer after gaming.)","cyw3v":"sarcastic. but scarily true. hark ps3 story?","czju1":"linux should stand on it's own merits, and not have to draw comparisons to competitors in every sentence.\r\n\r\npretending linux can run a vista-esque user experience, on a computer dating back 10+ years is both wrong, and misleading. \r\n\r\nadditionally, also on the frontpage of reddit today, is how to run linux on a playstation 3... hardly a 300mhz computer now, is it.\r\nif linux is the right choice for you, use it. but don't hook it up to the next and proclaim the second coming in the form of tux. it got old in 1992.","c110pe":"It could be argued\/suggested, however, that time between 13-22 is also an enormously fertile time for humans as far as creativity goes.  An engaged community and aspirational kids can do things with a creative result.  There are not a lot of restrictions that limit things like these kids learning to paint, sculpt, woodcraft, starting a band, working on novels, writing plays, learning classical instruments, etc.  \r\nA book I had when I was a kid said that if you're bored, it's because you're not thinking creatively enough.\r\nIf you think that the productive output of teenage humans is wasted, you're ignoring a lot of kids who already do these things. \r\nI agree with you.  I'm sick of people seeing school as crowd control, but we're also okay with a playstation nation.  I hate the fact that teachers are forced to teach by tests, and the fact that so many kids have to approach afterschool\/extracurricular activities as so many points to get on a resume so they can get into school.  A thorough reform is needed.\r\nHOWEVER, in an \"advanced society\" such as ours, we have extended the amount of non-work years we have ahead of us.  I don't think we should replace school with parenthood.  I came from a small town and there were plenty of people who only had seventh-grade educations and plenty of trade education.  Some of them have great lives now, but many of them are far from where they could be.  I think a better answer is allowing kids and parents the choice of magnet schools that teach traditional curriculum as well as the job training that you suggest.\r\nP.S. The high school system can also be manipulated.  It came to me my freshman year that by taking ONE summer class, I could graduate in three years, with honors.  However, it's tough to focus on college when you're 17, so we come back to the point that we don't raise teenagers who are self-sufficient enough to take care of themselves- I'm tempted to use the Natalie Holloway example.","c115st":"On a somewhat related note...

I say cobbled because it happened more-or-less by accident, one bit at a time, as my 20 year old stereo and 10 year old TV failed.\r\n\r\nAnyway, setting the damn thing up to watch a DVD after playing playstation is a 2 minute project, even with a programmable remote. Ideally, you'd like to see an environment where a component, maybe a PC-type device, maybe the amp, accepts information from all the things plugged into it and sorts out for itself which should be enabled at what time - for example, automatically switching the amp to DVD input and surround sound mode when the DVD player comes on.","c11mqq":"The year is 2078 and the latest playstation has been released.See the Future\r\n","c12nkf":"the point is. spotlight didn't show up until after the system-wide search. are you saying that it took 10 years for apple to make spotlight.. because if you are, you're talking bollocks.\r\n\r\nwhat pisses bill gates, and microsoft supporters off is that steve jobs has the audacity, cheek, and arrogance to wildly claim that features they have stolen from microsoft belong to him.. and then to go one better and to claim the redmon photocopiers are working overtime.\r\n\r\nyou only have to look at leopard to see that a vast majority of features being incorporated there are direct feature by feature copies of functionality that exists in vista, but not in osx 10.4\r\n\r\nthe apple \/ pc adverts are another thing, in which for the sake of making apple look like this cool 'punkd' style hip young teenager, they blatantly take the piss out of a competitor.

The only ones that do come out on console first do so because of deals that offer exclusive rights to the parent company of whatever console it is.  I mean gears or war looks ok but it's just a FPS...  As far as the current generation of consoles, the Wii is cool until the idea of an accellerometer wears off.  Then you look at the current titles and say \"where's the beef\".  If the biggest draw to your console is \"innovative game play\" (see neato controller gimmick) there isn't much of a shelf life there...and yes I played Wii and liked it but there are only so many times yo can play virtual bowling before you realize that the real thing is more fun.   PS3 is a joke, the hardware is overly complicated and expensive and devs are crippled so badly by the sub-par dev kit that companies like EA are taking a pass.  XBox 360 is ok but it's just a glorified PC.  The biggest draw to the 360 is that a company can write a game for PC and Xbox360 using basically the same SDK cuttign dev costs considerably.  That and XBOX Live which seems like a rip to me.  All of the best games on the market.  WOW, Total Annaihalation, Company of Heros, Halflife 2, Counter Strike, Battlefield 2, Pirates, The Sims, Spore, Crysis, Any decent flight sim, Command And Conquer, Second Life, Call Of Duty, Oblivion, Hitman, UT, Doom, Quake, STALKER, LOTR Online, Civ, Total war series, tycoon series, Ghost recon, rainbow 6, the list goes on and on.  THen start thinking about the harware coming down the pipe like physics cards and true 3d monitors and let me know when your PSThwii-sixty will support that stuff.  The ONLY 3 games I ever wanted to play that I couldn't get on console immediatly were GTA (which started on the pc), Katamari Damaci, and that ps2 game where you kill the huge monsters.  Consoles are for jocks and geek-chic metros who think the Wii is like an interactive iPod.  Sorry I'll take my pc any day.","c16v8r":"As a uni lecturer, this is painfully true.

Then again, they also own the rights to a giant catalog of grade-A movies that they restrict to their format.

I should note, I don't want to look too much like I'm defending Sony here - I haven't quite bought a ps3, and I've bought\/sold a Wii (didn't like); but we'll see.  \r\n- Blu-Ray. I see this as a sharp reason to subsidize our purchase of the ps3; but compared to other blu-ray players the ps3's price is great. You can read the amazon reviews of people who buy them just for that. I don't think anyone is getting ripped off here unless they are out buying HD-DVD movies.  This is the strongest reason for Sony to 'dump' the system, although they do share some of those royalties with subsidaries.  \r\n- HDTV's, I think that is an unfair assumption against Sony. While it's true driving HD sales helps them, it's not like they have a monopoly, and the average consumer is no longer brand-loyal. I have an HP HDTV, Sony PS2, Samsung everything else.  \r\n- Finally -Yes, and this is value for the customer, not just Sony. You can swap in\/out drives on the ps3. You aren't at the whim of Microsoft or trying to keep track of 20 different SD cards with your Wii.  \r\nMost importantly, I think your comment about 'I don't think it is something gamers should have to pay for'; with xbox you are paying to Unify and monopolize online gaming under the MS roof? You are further causing O\/S lock-in for their windows environment (Stream media, etc).  \r\nThe argument for\/against unified online is obviously a different topic, I don't mean to use it to argue the original point.","c27iql":"I disagree: \"Boy sent playstation for his birthday\" for example is perfectly valid.","c27jo2":"&gt; You didn't design a mips32, you layed it out.

The interesting stuff...microcodes, architecture, theory, instructional efficiency trade-offs.\r\n\r\n&gt;That's hardly engineering level design.\r\n\r\nThere's no such thing as engineering level design. There's engineering and design. The stuff you described is the uninteresting grunt work (unless you're doing research on the theories behind those methodologies). If that could be considered more related to design than cpu architecture design, then your \"design\" examples would be laughable compared to what kind of \"design\" the work done on the quantum-mechanical properties of transistors and electron flow turbulence in physics. And I hope you don't consider that stuff design, because physicists sure as hell don't.\r\n\r\nAs I've heard many a physics professor say, the trouble with engineers is that they think of everything in terms of implementation, not design. Is the hybrid of mechanical mixing and magnetic mixing of polar molecules in liquids on a micro-scale design? No more than profiling a diffusion oven. Design is abstract. It guides implementation, rather than defining it.\r\n\r\n&gt;The vast majority of woodworkers learn on the job. I took shop in high school and built a china hutch.\r\n\r\nBuilding a china hutch in wood shop is to woodworking as making a half-adder on a bread board is to computer engineering. The \"woodworkers\" you are talking about are the equivalent of wire-pullers.","c27tq3":"how do you get the ps3 controller to work on your pc","c28lr1":"will try out, but nuttin can come close to the hours of guitar hero on the ps2 :P","c29xwn":"Part 2:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www2.uol.com.br\/flashpops\/jogos\/flashpops2.shtml","c2d1nr":"Nothing surprising here, but the fact that they have reworked the design won't help if anyone claims against them for defects in the design.\r\n\r\nThe original playstation went through a few revisions as well with thermal issues.","c2drnt":"i guess this breaks a hole in their assertion that 'the ps3 is not a game system it is a media system'.","c2eojw":"I think it'll be replaced.

I've watched normal DVD's in my ps3, and I could only see replacing the top-end ones - most will be fine to keep in dvd format.\r\nI think studios are going to find with things like, Heroes Season 1, Bourne Ultimatum, etc that there sales are lack-luster.

They help renew the forest, and forests of this type that have been \"over protected\" have gradually faded and died. Those are not my words, but come from scientists specialized in the field. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn one article I recently read, the author (PhD on the subject) said he could not stress enough that building a house in a forest is equal to building one on the sand of a beach, the banks of a river or a waterfall. It is dangerous, and should be banned, not only to protect forests but people too.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT, this may not be the case here, at least not in some of the fires in greece right now. \r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not all of these fires were 'natural', some of them were the result of criminal activity. \r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, those poor village people that lost their lives,(others) their homes and their belongings, were not necessarily guilty of building their houses too close to the woods, and those villages had co-existed with their neighbouring forests peacefully and without any problems, for years, or even centuries. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo, you could be right, but being cruel and so unsympathetic does not do good to the truths you've spoken :)\r\n\r\n\r\nps. sorry for the poor english\r\nps2. edited for some typos","c2jfz8":"This is why no one under 30 is allowed to comment here.

Parents have literally asked them for advice on raising their kids and how to make them do their homework. \r\n\r\n\"Well, he doesn't want to do it, how can I make sure he does.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he have a playstation or an xbox or something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah...\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't let him use it until he finishes his work.\"\r\n\r\nIt's not that hard. \r\n\r\nI really don't think its bad

as a primary development platform.\r\nAnd you still want to have your code portable to ps3 and maybe PC too.\r\n\r\nSo no C# for most gamedevelopers in the near future (pheeeww =).","c029dx8":"I play a lot of console games. I've been a console gamer since the Atari 2600. but I've also been a PC gamer since the Commodore 64. Since the 16-bit era, I've prided myself on having all the major consoles of any given generation (though I still have yet to pick up the ps3). It's not that I'm one or the other, I follow the quality; I'm a connoisseur, if you will. I consider myself well versed enough to make an unbiased distinction.\n\nIt's certainly no puzzle why Halo is so popular in comparison. PC gaming is an *expensive* hobby if you want to keep up with the tech. So consoles, often costing about as much as a good video card alone, tend to be a much more accessible option to the mainstream, especially since you only have to swap them out once every 5 years or so.\n\nI'd hesitate to use the term *jealous*, though. (old-school) Gamers in general always been kind of an elitist group, and the majority of PC gamers would probably *hate* it if everyone from xbox live started playing with them (This is one reason I don't think multi-platform multiplay will ever really hit it off).   \nIt's just that when a game like Halo 2 gets a higher rating than a game like Half-Life 2 from the same publication, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Regardless of the console sensation that Halo might be, HL2 was an unequivocally superior experience for those to whom it was available.\n\n*My* problem, from a state-of-the-industry standpoint, is now every game developer is trying to ride the Halo 2 success train and putting out all these crap FPS titles for consoles. I'd rather they stuck to what they're good at.\n\n I'm looking forward to assassin's creed and mass effect more than most other things at the moment.","c029mns":"  They threw out this same publicity line when the [Playstation 2 came out](http:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2000\/12\/19\/iraq_buys_4000_playstation_2s\/).  I don't buy it that this guy came up with the idea on his own, just in time for them to be ramping up for Christmas sales.\n\nIt's kind of sad that they can't come up with a new (or even good) publicity angle for their console.\n\n  ","c029mr3":"I'm also rather skeptical, but given the amazing performance the [folding@home](http:\/\/folding.stanford.edu\/) people have managed to get out of the ps3, I think the story might have some truth to it.","c029ni5":" I work with a professor who uses a playstation for the IBM cell engine research. Apparently, the processing power is great for certain applications. It was kinda funny when he ordered it. We had to get him to justify using academic funds for a playstation...he did so with amazing clarity. The processor really has some benefits to research and raw processing power, if you know what you are doing. ","c029nuo":"Further, in the XMB (the O\/S), there is actually an option \"Install another O\/S\"; they have no qualms if you want to buy a ps3 and make it a linux box.","c02ad3c":" It is ironic you say that.  I gave up with the quest for even a playable game on Linux.  The emulators are awesome though.  I am playing FFT (final fantasy tactics) with the psx and it plays almost like theplaystation.  I will probably check out Wine as well. \n\nWhat is even more embarrasing are these silly games that come with Ubuntu for example; Nibbles?  Wtf, why would any human being want to play nibbles?  I dont care what office you work for?","c02b04r":"ok, my kid is ten..he has a ball the size of an orange. He says 'waaa-i want a ps3 b4 I go to the hospital'. I beat the crap out of him, then drag him to the hospital. He has both balls. The end.","c02bf7s":"s2, ps2-cheats, ps2cheats, playstation2, playstation-2-cheats, cheats, ps2-game-cheats, ps2-codes, ps2-hacks, ps2-hints, ps2-secrets","c02bi6o":"I don't think this is all that outrageous, although I'd say it seems fairly certain that after three years there must be some internal politics motivating this investigation.\n\nBut, fundamentally, she took a suspect's property home, bypassing the paperwork and other systems of accountability the law requires.  It sounds like she had the animal's, and likely the family's, best interests in mind, but still she violated policy.\n\nThe law views a dog property and not much more.  If she had taken the suspect's playstation home for two days she'd have received a much harsher punishment, even though the law probably views them as similar transgressions.\n\nThis is apparently not the first time that this officer has taken liberties with a suspect's property.  I think anything that encourages cops to view our property as sacred and not to be taken with without well-defined justification, documentation and accountability is a good thing.","c02bki6":"the tv is always just \"there\"  everyone has one.  I imagine he had a lot of \"mom can I pleeeeaaasseee!  havea PS2?\"  days to get the ps2.","c02bm0a":"I've always said that the first side to make a sub-$200 player was going to be the one that would win. Look at sales figures. That seems to be the magic number for electronics. The majority of ps2 were sold after they dropped below $200. Same for dvd players originally.","c02bmjo":"Correct.\n\nIf you loaned a friend your ps3 and later that day he trips and falls and smashes it, wouldn't you feel entitled to something?\n\nAt best person A can hope for is that person B is very kind and will let person A off the hook for all or some of the price of the item.","c02cu78":"Toshiba is stating those hardware sales sans ps3, ie, if we pretend ps3 doesn't play bluray, we are slightly outselling them.","c02daux":"How long will studios continue to publish blu-ray disks when people are buying hd-dvd players. One of the things that people forget about beta versus vhs is that vhs started edging beta out, because vhs was cheaper and could hold a full movie. The full movie bit doesn't really matter, because both blu-ray and hd-dvd are equal in that area, but price is one of the first things people look to. Most people have no clue about the technical differences between the 2 formats, but any idiot can wrap their head around a $200-$300 price difference. I just bought my $99 hd-dvd player today. If blu-ray is to continue to be viable, they at least need to get the price of players down to $200.\n\nedit: The magic price point for consumer electronics seems to be $200. Most of the ps2 were sold after the price dropped below $200. That's why I knew that the ps3 wouldn't sell in the numbers that Sony was expecting. They priced their console higher than consumer tolerance, and left themselves little leeway to lower price quickly.","c02e954":"parents who engage in 'stings' of this nature probably should be 'hit'. sound to me like this 'family' has a WHOLE LOT of OTHER problems. the playstation isn't the real issue. they have a typical 'b' movie, disney dumbass perspective on what life and family is. goddamned xtian pretards.\n\nhopefully this 'kid' gets far away from this 'family' and FAST. (on his own dime). reality will straighten him out or kill him.","c02eebu":"Do atheists actually attempt to find God, and then come to the conclusion that there is no God, or do they observe the followers and what they hear and conclude that God cannot exist?\n\nIn my own attempt to conclude his existence, I have ended up leaning more towards his existence then not. I study Sikhism and the things that it teaches actually help me deal with my problems all the time.\n\nThis semester I am taking 5 classes 4 undergrad and 1 grad. I was about to go insane from the stress. I would have probably needed months\/years of talking to a shrink. During one of my reading sessions (approx 1 hour) I came to a realization that I had not gotten where I was by stressing over my tasks. The cause was that I had grown an ego since I was taking a graduate course. I had not gotten where I was because of anything special about me. I had gotten here by working hard and thats it. I love the sciences and I was willing to put hours investigating problems. Now I just played my ps3 and complained about my problems, no wonder I was doing horrible in school and stressing over my grades. I got to where I am not by caring about my grades, but by the interest that the subject creates within me.\n\nWhich book should I have read to come to this conclusion?\n\nThe real reason of my own personal belief in God is that this ALWAYS works. The real problem is that I am actually influenced by logic and reason and cannot understand why reading about God and his relationship with this world should help me with my random problem. I often over look it and only come back to it when I have no other real hope.\n\nI am sorry but what I believe is not by blind faith, but by my own experience.","c02ejhi":"i would get one. i never got a ps2, though i had wanted one. it plays all the great games. a new ps2 design would basically be a \"perfect\" ps2 where all the design flaws, at least in principle would have been worked out because the bugs came up during its initial life.","c02fhw5":"man, I wish I could mod the ps2 version. \n\nseems like I've got a choice between sparing my eyes and spoiling my hands, or sparing my hands and spoiling my eyes...\n","c02fmmt":"ps3 ftw\n","c02fuob":"I know people who make plenty to live on, and still have nothing in their bank account.  In fact, I knew a lady who's combined income with her husband was almost 72k a year, and they had nothing in their bank account.  Almost everyone lives beyond their means, and that is why they remain where they are, or worsen their situation.  \n\nHow many of you people complaining of \"taxation\" got 90% or more of your taxes back at the end of the year then blow it on useless crap like dvds and new tvs or playstations and xboxes.  That is why they give you it back, to boost up the economy because they know the average person will waste their entire tax credit before they even have got it from the govt.\n\nI made 22k a year 3 years ago and when I got my taxes back that year, I saved it and started a business.  Glad I did.  But I pay 20x what most pay in taxes, and I get nothing back and I work my ass off for the money I give to the government.","c02fyqm":"No sympathy whatsoever. Did this guy really think after Sony treated their customers like dirt for both the psx and the ps2 that they'd suddenly come around for the ps3? You buy a Sony product now, after their track record is so well known, then you get what you deserve.","c02fysw":"i used to repair sony playstation 2's.  the origional machines were designed to draw air and dust through the cd drive.  you get a little dust in there and it wont read the disks, you get a lot of dust in there and it collects and binds with the grease on the motor and burns it out.\n\ni tape up some holes and put a couple pieces of thin foam across the air vents leading to the cd drive. and as far as i know no one has had a problem with their machine again.\n\nthe origional ps2 was made to fail.  seems like this is true for the ps3 as well.\n","c02fzr0":"I leave my ps3 on 24 hours a day, I haven't had a single problem with it; I love the thing.

","c02oyqj":"Ok so I was trolling a little bit here, but the underlying message is true.  Rock band is on 2 consoels (possibly 3 with the wii) guitar hero is on ps2, the controllers are not compatible with anything else other than guitar hero titles.  There is also another set of controllers for this game for the 360, wii, and ps3.  Maximizing their profits on proprietary controllers would seem like it would be in their own best interests.  I know a good number of people that have thrown down for 4-6 controllers across 3 consoles and just as many titles. \n\nIt just seems amazing to me that these should be fairly standard USB controllers, that are owned by the consumer, and should be fairly easy to write a driver for.  I really think this IP squabble is going to prove to be just another reason to avoid buying a ps3.  Hell if I were Microsoft I would pay both sides huge amounts of money to fight this in court, and create a media circus.  It all comes down to sony not attempting to mediate this, or put together a common license agreement that covers 3rd party licensed control devices.","c02p4vo":"Yes, some of the stats are very interesting. HD is selling more stand alone players; they will often quote the install base without including PS3. Most arguments start with the 2:1 thing, then someone brings up HD's larger stand-alone install base, then someone brings up the ps3, then someone says ok bluray has a larger install base so that means they are selling at a lower attach rate since they should be higher than 2:1; then some audiophile will go into how neither format has true lossless audio yet.  \r\nOne of HD's bigger arguments was PiP, which bluray players have as of last night (PS3 update 2.1 last night included DiVX\/WMV and PiP for BluRay)\r\n","c02ppru":"PS3 fanboy declared his nominees for the best ps3 driving game for 2007.

Not in the fact that this movement seems to be very unofficial, I'm dissapointed of the cynacism displayed by everyone, especially those whom are actually indian.  Native Americans were out right robbed of their land, to make room for European religious fanatics who took everything and made them second class citizens.  It's a sad but true fact that Native Americans are almost as low as you can get on the American social ladder, and yet even their own people dismiss this movement.  If it is unofficial, then Native Americans should get behind it, not make snide comments over the internet.  This is the best chance your culture has ever had to save itself.  This is a completely legal way to restore the culture you have for thousands of years and take back what was stolen from you all those years ago.  But as I read all the comments here I fel nothing but contempt for those whose collective cynacism will probably bury this movement.  And for what?  Read through the comments and you'll see the general concensus is that indians would rather keep their pityful government checks rather then do it tough until they can get on their feet.  Rather then restore their heritage they want to remain in trailers and sill have cable, playstation and drugs.  Any indian that doesn't get behind this cause is scum in my eyes.  Right now I can hear the collective sniggers of the prodominately whiote reddit crowd.  Even if this were a serious movement many of you wouldn't really want it to happen because you live in the places they want to take back.  It would take your happy little comfort zone from you.  So you can say you want them to get theirs back, or more likely, you bad-mouth this from internet forums thinking that just because you don't swear in your 'arguement' it is sensible and cohesive.  This movement has a better chance of succeeding then impeachment or even, shock horror, Ron Paul getting elected.  I am dissapointed that the one real chance Native Americans are going to have to save their culture is going to fall on deaf ears due to the cynacism of our age.

I own an xbox, ps2 and a wii, and the wii gets the most play because there's no lack of *1st party*, family friendly games that *aren't* dumbed down for children (i.e., Disney titles).

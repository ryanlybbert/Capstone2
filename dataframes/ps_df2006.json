And she answered that those were fixed expenses: you buy them once, and you can enjoy them for several years.  Meanwhile, if you didn't buy them, it'd pay for enough food to last maybe 2 weeks, and then you'd be both hungry *and* bored.\r\n\r\nOn an amortized basis, these iPods and PS3s are maybe $10\/month (assuming you don't break your iPods every couple months, as several of my more well-off friends do).

(Remember, that's why Squaresoft switched to Sony)\r\n\r\nThose things said, I do agree that Sony is on the path to failure for being hardware driven, overpricing their system (even if they lose money), and making boring games. God bless the Wii!","cvvto":"I love the fanboy comments for ps3.","cw1mj":"considering that 'playstation' would include playstation, playstation 2, and playstation 3 -- and that wii could only include the new nintendo wii -- I find that quite impressive.","cw3lq":"What a load of crap!! I don't know whether people are returning their PS3s but PS3 is selling good at ebay.\r\nJust check this\r\nhttp:\/\/search.ebay.com\/search\/search.dll?cgiurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.com%2Fws%2F&amp;fkr=1&amp;from=R8&amp;satitle=ps3&amp;category0=&amp;submitSearch=Search","cw3m0":"it's obvious ps3 was released way way too early. there aren't any games for it yet.","cw463":"&gt; The scheme: make supply scarce so that the supply-demand curve is skewed and they can set a very high price.\r\n\r\nYou must have missed the news that Sony is losing $300+ on each ps3, even at its high price.\r\n\r\n&gt; A classy, honest company beat a scheming, greedy company.\r\n\r\nYou're confused.","cw4kw":"The PS3 is not yet available worldwide. Perhaps this person lives in some far-flung place like Australia or NZ.\r\n\r\n[Sony Australia for example](http:\/\/au.playstation.com)","cw5nr":"In general, if demand outstrips supply, it is because things are *under*priced, not overpriced.\r\n\r\nWhat makes you think that sony's supply problems were caused by cynical marketing whereas nintendo's were trying hard to ship as many as they can?  If the PS3 had turned out cool, then the tables would be reversed; people would be offering [$250 + BJ](http:\/\/www.lolitron.org\/2006\/12\/24\/mom-offers-250-and-a-blowjob-for-a-wii\/) for a ps3 whilst wii's were being returned to the store.  And then everyone would be calling nintendo the evil company for 'artificially restricting supply' whilst sony was simply 'swamped with demand'."},"year":{"c5iqp":"2006","c5vr3":"2006","c8ww4":"2006","ccbf5":"2006","ccgt0":"2006","cchm7":"2006","ccj8h":"2006","ce6br":"2006","cfevd":"2006","cfk11":"2006","cfkat":"2006","cfx7u":"2006","ci700":"2006","ciorg":"2006","cj92w":"2006","ck4t2":"2006","cpsot":"2006","cqgm5":"2006","cqpxw":"2006","cqr3s":"2006","cqsxo":"2006","cqt7c":"2006","cqyu5":"2006","crj9g":"2006","csk3n":"2006","cskfi":"2006","ct6kh":"2006","ctfhz":"2006","ctg2a":"2006","ctjsh":"2006","ctlwt":"2006","ctmr8":"2006","ctsv9":"2006","ctv6s":"2006","cu2y8":"2006","cubtw":"2006","cue1r":"2006","cvuv2":"2006","cvvto":"2006","cw1mj":"2006","cw3lq":"2006","cw3m0":"2006","cw463":"2006","cw4kw":"2006","cw5nr":"2006"},"month":{"c5iqp":"05","c5vr3":"05","c8ww4":"06","ccbf5":"08","ccgt0":"08","cchm7":"08","ccj8h":"08","ce6br":"08","cfevd":"08","cfk11":"08","cfkat":"08","cfx7u":"09","ci700":"09","ciorg":"09","cj92w":"09","ck4t2":"09","cpsot":"11","cqgm5":"11","cqpxw":"11","cqr3s":"11","cqsxo":"11","cqt7c":"11","cqyu5":"11","crj9g":"11","csk3n":"11","cskfi":"11","ct6kh":"12","ctfhz":"12","ctg2a":"12","ctjsh":"12","ctlwt":"12","ctmr8":"12","ctsv9":"12","ctv6s":"12","cu2y8":"12","cubtw":"12","cue1r":"12","cvuv2":"12","cvvto":"12","cw1mj":"12","cw3lq":"12","cw3m0":"12","cw463":"12","cw4kw":"12","cw5nr":"12"}}

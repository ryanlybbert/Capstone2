like playing pool as well as playing Fallout 3.\n&gt;The Wii on an HDTV doesn't look terrible, but it is in dire need of a higher resolution or anti-aliasing. \n\n\nUhhhh... what was that about AA? The 360 and ps3 don't have AA either, and Fallout 3 has more jaggies than any game I've ever seen in my life. \n\n\n\n&gt;Just because, with enough hacking and special effects, Nintendo is able to make their console into something great does not mean it is.\n\nChrist, that is the dumbest thing I have ever read. There is no hacking and special effects, it is simply a good design team and decent programmers. Do you have *any idea* how much harder it is to code for the PS3 than it is for the Wii? All the \"hacking\" is on that side of the field, where you have to jump through hoops to get even decent results out of an absurdly complex architecture. ","820t":"The zune 30gb is arguably a superior product to all but the top of the ipod lineup. the failings of Microsoft's attempts at marketing such a product do not require the product itself to be a failure. If nothing else Microsoft has failed only at convincing early adopters to jump ship from Apple.\n\n\nZune's current Zunepass \"unlimited plus ten\" is by far the best legal way for the masses to experience music. For 15 bucks a month I can download unlimited rental tracks AND get 10 purchased tracks which are mine to keep AND a single zunepass is good for 3 zune media players and 3 computers.\n\nI've owned 4 different generations of Apple ipods including the ipod touch and I still think that zune is more a marketing failure than a conceptual or executional failure. (ipod:zune::ps2:xbox), Inclusion of zune software in the forthcoming version of windows mobile (6.5 &amp; 7 both due in 2009) should make (ipod:zune::ps3:xbox360).

I haven't played fallout in a while, so I can't give good directions. \n\nIf you talk to people in Arefu, they drop hints that letter boy was probably taken by the family. The location at the hide-away is a dead end, but it's useful for that locked gate you found. You'll eventually meet a character who gives you the key if you help him (actually, it's the guy who Moriarty tells you to see). \n\nBut, with that letter quest, if you talk to the ghoul in the subway station, he tells you where the brotherhood is. Or at least drops a hint. Just go to the radiated room and jump down the manhole.\n\n&gt;The whole game feels clunky. Pipboy, interface, bizarre keys, everything. I haven't gotten a vehicle yet (don't know if you ever get them) and the run speed is ridiculously slow so going anywhere I can't fast travel to is arduous and boring. You pretty much run in a straight line and knife molerats. Even worse, unlike Oblivion, jumping repeatedly doesn't seem to level up your agility in any way, so the simple act of moving from one location to another is as boring is it can possibly be.\n\nI think pipboy is an acquired taste. I'm not sure how it looks on the computer though. You don't get any vehicles. The skill system is based off of the previous fallout games rather than the method they used in oblivion. You need to level up to improve any of your stats in this game.\n\nYou don't seem to enjoy the game, so I wouldn't recommend you *buy* it, if you were a renter . . . but since you already laid out the money, I'd give it another try. Maybe pick up a walkthrough until your used to it. It's not because I love the game (which I do), but because I'd be upset if I wasted $40.","8sf8":"fuck, i should ask for a stimulus...  i need some ps3 games, some more porn, and a couple of pizzas delivered from pizza hut...","8vw3":"&gt;   Games have no installation time.\n\nNot true, ever used a PS3?  The installation of a game means it loads much faster than trying to run off of optical media.\n\n&gt;   You know that game is going to work the same way on your console as it does on anyone else's console.\n\nNot true - for example, some PS3's can play PS2 games well, some can kind of play them, others can't play jack\n\n&gt;   Consoles cost substantially less.\n\nWrong. http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gaming\/comments\/7l04h\/graphics_of_pc_vs_xbox_vs_ps3_side_by_side\/2uk5\n\n$246 for a PC that destroys Xbox and PS3 in graphical ability.  Also - most people *need* a computer for work\/entertainment anyways, so why not spend a few extra dollars for a video card and make it a gaming station.\n\n&gt;   Consoles require far less maintenance than a PC\n\nRROD?  I don't know what \"maintenance\" you're talking about, but at least if something goes wrong with a PC, I can fix it myself rather than paying the manufacturer ungodly amounts and waiting a month.\n\n&gt;   Keeping a PC in a state of being able to run new games requires frequent updates, hardware changes and performance tweaks.\n\nAgain, incorrect - you can build an entirely new computer for $246 dollars.  If your graphics card is outdated (main thing that makes it not possible to play), you can buy a new one for $75 bucks.\n\n&gt;   Consoles are much easier to play with friends.\n\nIn the same room?  LAN party (easy and way more fun than a shitty console match).  Internet?  Non-MMORPG games on the PC usually have *free* online play with tons of customization where-as you have to pay to play on Xbox Live and the service is lame. \n\n&gt;   Consoles are probably connected to the biggest monitor in the house.\n\nExcept the resolution sucks.  Also, you can hook a computer up to a TV with a $5 cable.\n\n&gt;   Consoles generally have a way to attach a keyboard to them. PS3 even accepts mice I think.\n\nWrong.  You can use a mouse and keyboard for **1** console (the PS3), but it is not supported for most games.\n\n&gt;   Updating games works much better on consoles than PCs where game companies are still reinventing the game updater with every game. (Exception is Steam)\n\nWhat?  Before the latest series of consoles, if a game had a bug, too bad.  Now they can release updates automatically but so do a lot of PC games.\n\n&gt;  Console graphics just aren't that different from PC graphics.\n\nYes they are - not just the texture quality of the graphics, but the resolution (limited by the TV on a console) makes a huge difference.  Add to that, the processing power of video cards versus consoles makes ambient lighting, shadows, etc way better on a PC.\n\n&gt;  Consoles are where the money is at for the big game pulishers right now so a lot of games are coming out for consoles.\n\nConsoles have an abundant quantity of games (shitty ones)... and yet the *quality* of games on the PC is usually much better.  Also, there are almost no RTS, Simulation, etc games on consoles.\n\n&gt;  A lot easier for a game company to QA a console than to QA PC games because of the infinite number of configurations a PC can have for hardware and software.\n\nSo?  That's like saying the space shuttle sucks because there are so many different parts and walking is a way better method of travel.\n\nMost games are built on existing libraries and engines (DirectX, etc), so Q&amp;A isn't a crapshoot.\n\n&gt;  Consoles can receive OS updates the same way PCs can.\n\nWrong.  Consoles can receive standardized OS updates from the manufacturer.  PCs can update their OS however they want (they can even switch OSes).\n\n&gt;  People can buy used console games.\n\nPeople can buy used PC games.  Also, most PC games are $10 cheaper than their console counterparts because they don't have to pay licensing fees to the console maker (good for small-time publishers).\n\n&gt;  Gamefly is for console games.\n\nPiratebay is for PCs.

The recently released Melamine Plate kit (Abraxis, Warminster, Pa.) displayed a limit of detection of 9 ng\/ml for melamine in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and approximately 1 \u00b5g\/ml for melamine added to dog food. An atrazine ELISA test kit produced by Abraxis required 0.2 mg\/ml to generate a response more than four times the standard deviation from background. In contrast, with the EnviroGard Triazine Plate kit (Strategic Diagnostics, Inc., Newark, Del.), 1.5 mg\/ml melamine in PBS generated a signal only one standard deviation from background, which was insufficient to define a limit of detection. Extraction based on dilution with 105 mM sodium phosphate\/75 mM NaCl\/2.5% nonfat milk\/0.05% Tween 20 (UD) enabled detection of fivefold less melamine in dog food than did use of the procedure recommended by the manufacturer, which entailed extraction into 60% methanol, sonication, centrifugation, filtration, and further dilution into 10% methanol\/PBS. Using the Abraxis Melamine ELISA, both extraction protocols yielded identical results with a dog food sample adulterated with melamine. The recovery of melamine spiked into gravy from dog food using UD was 74% \u00b1 4%.

They quickly moved to Granville, NY, which at the time, was VERY rural. He was the third in a line of ten children to the family. He, by my deductions, wanted to be respected and loved as though the 10 kids were only three. But I have a feeling that when you basically pop out new kids every 9 months, some of them get left behind, as my father clearly did. At 14 (I think, i know it was between 13 and 15) he was kicked out of his house for an undisclosed reason and that winter was forced (partly by his father, partly by his own stubbornness) to live in a broken down truck by the mettowee river. He did not speak to his father until I was born, when he was 23. Come spring he moved in with his grandmother (who just died this past new years day) until he was 17. He dropped out of high school in his sophomore year, as he was better at construction and pot than school (although if I remember correctly, he was brilliant with math). He worked a variety of construction related jobs, hung around your typical drunks\/bikers\/junkies, and wandered around eastern NY\/Western VT until he met my mother when he was 19. If I remember correctly, they married when he was 21, and she was 19. She was an art student (and quite good at it, just like his own mother), but dropped out of college for him. He was always too concerned that she would meet someone else, and leave. He was a fighter. Constantly in bar fights. She was a pacifist. She got beat up. A lot. When She was 20, and he was 23, I was born. We lived in shithole after shithole, while he would work small construction jobs in between disappearing for weeks on end, and she would find whatever work was available to keep things going. He would eventually come back again and again, and looking back now, I think he was trying to self destruct. He was always so worried about everyone disappearing, that i think he was trying to keep his distance. We moved around a lot. He was there sometimes. but he was pissed a lot. My sister was born 3 years after me. He and her got along better than he and I, but I think that's because he felt like he had to protect her, and I had to learn to live hard, like he had. He eventually, by the time my sister was 2 (1989 now) stranded us in Orinville, ME. which, if you don't know, is literally NOWHERE. the sides of the schoolbus read \"Unorganized Territory 13\". He disappeared for the summer. My mom later said that he would disappear back to new york with whatever new girlfriend for benders, basically. He came back, in as ripe a mood as ever. It was normal though. Every family had these issues. it made no difference to me. Calling 911 to save my mothers life was at least a once a month occurrence. He built me a tree house that fall. That was cool. I spent a lot of time there, while they \"talked\". We moved back to New York when I was 7, and he became a little reclusive. He worked even less, started to drink (strangely, he never was a big drinker, he just liked to hang out in bars) and became increasingly agitated with everything. I think that at this point, his mid 30's, he was realizing the footprint he was leaving. We were living in a campground for a while, most of my second grade year. My mother became the only parent really. there was Me, my sister, my mother, and Jim. You stay away from Jim if you can. We moved again, and we stayed there for the longest span, 5 years, almost. We lived in a decent apartment, near friends i had begun to make. I played alone in the woods a lot. My father began to get in better spirits as I got older. I think he was starting to think that he might still have a chance at changing things. We would go see action movies together. Jurassic Park is a big memory for me. We made a \"guy\" day out of it. He coached my little league team. He helped me in my boy scouts stuff. He was a dad. and it was awesome. The last two years in that apartment are the happiest memories i have of him, of my family, of my childhood. Thing were great. We moved again. we lived in our new place, across town for two months before he began his shit again. Pot, coke, whiskey. constantly. fighting every night. every day. He found a new girlfriend, and didn't bother trying to hide her. He sat me and my sister down at the table one night. I was 12, she was 9. He said \"Your mom and I have decided that things would be better If I go get my own apartment\". I don't remember what i did or said. But I can remember that that had been it. I saw my dad once in his new apartment before he showed up in our driveway that winter with a bottle of jack and a gun. My mom snuck my sister and I out of the lower driveway, through the woods, to the neighbors house. I guess the cops came and that was it. When I was 14 I got into some trouble (i won't go into it, but things were in the shitter)and he showed up. He started following me around town. trailing me in his car. Eventually he stopped me and asked me if i needed money. I took some cash and left. I don't know what he expected to happen, or if he expected anything at all, but i didn't see him for another two years. He had remarried, and had started a tiling company (he and his wife would tile your floor if you wanted). I made a second trip to a hospital, and when I came out, I needed a place to stay. I stayed with him for two months. It was pot and playstation, which was fine with me at the time. He had started to learn guitar, as a way i think of trying to reconnect with me. i wanted no part of it. i just needed a roof. and i think he knew it. He tried to be cool for about 15 minutes at a time, and then it was \"your mother this, and blah blah blah\", then poof, he'd be gone for two days. I moved back out. Anyways, I am going to cut this short, because this is about him, not me, he has tried to make amends with me and my sister a few times in the past couple years. I can't do it. He is the same person he always was, and no matter what gesture he makes, he can't hide it. It's me, my sister, my mother and this guy i know, Jim. ","c06wutf":"I agree with jp007.

(2\/2)  [ynWsfvpxdaqjk], or ? for help: y\n    Finished recording patch 'Added impl on top of library.'\n\nBecause the library patch and the implementation patch can commute, Darcs doesn't realize the second depends on the first.  Thus, if you try to cherry-pick the implementation into another repo, you'll get a bogus project state that lacks the library:\n\n    [thor@helium commute-oops]$ mkdir ..\/commute-oops2\n    [thor@helium tmp]$ cd !$\n    cd ..\/commute-oops2\n    [thor@helium commute-oops2]$ darcs init\n    [thor@helium commute-oops2]$ darcs pull ..\/commute-oops\n    Fri Jan  9 16:01:26 EST 2009  Tom Moertel &lt;tom@moertel.com&gt;\n      * Added library\n    Shall I pull this patch?

For example, when we recorded the implementation patch, we should have remembered to tell Darcs that it depends on the library (note the \"--ask-deps\" flag):\n\n    [thor@helium commute-oops]$ darcs record --ask-deps -m 'Added impl using lib.'\n    addfile .\/impl1\n    Shall I record this change?

Never looked back.  There's an interesting article in [kotoku](http:\/\/kotaku.com\/5131077\/2k-boss-wii-market-is-full-of-crap) about how wii's gaming market is so congested with crappy games, that it might be bad for the entire industry.  That might be going too far, but it's a general feeling that the rest of the industry have towards the wii.  While numbers will keep people believing that the wii is THE gaming console of choice, there are [studies](http:\/\/news.cnet.com\/ps2-crushes-wii-xbox-in-gaming-minutes\/) that show the time collectively spent on the 360 outweighs the time collectively spent on the wii.  Of course that study also shows that PS2 is still dominating both.  So if you're talking about sales, Nintendo has won this generation by a large margin.  In terms of what people play, then its a different story.","c0731qm":"Just because I make a generalization doesn't mean I'm wrong.  I know a lot of people in their 20s, and I don't know a single one that plays the Wii.  I know many many more who play xbox and pc.  As a matter of fact I know someone who has never bought anything but nintendo and has sworn by that company for his entire life, even defending the game cube as better than the xbox 1 or ps2, leave nintendo and buy a 360 because of what nintendo has done to their would-be innovative console.  I am confident in defending my generalization because in my experience those who are called \"casual gamers\" only play flash games or Wii Sports.  \n\nMaybe I am elitist.  I've begun to forget with the constant use of the word that being called an elitist is a compliment.  However, connoisseur would be a better term.  \n\nIt is true that video game companies started pouring out shit that looked good to meet the expectations of the masses.  Video games were so much more entertaining when the people who played them actually cared.  Game companies can just turn out mediocre shit because most people are mediocre.  Same with coffee, or beer, or wine.  Most people just don't give a shit and its the few who do that are left behind.\n\nI don't know why you think I would be sad about being a minority.  Those who search for quality in its highest sense have always been a minority, at least in my lifetime.\n\nI also find it funny that you reprimand me for making sweeping generalizations and then use sweeping generalizations to make your point.\n\nFinally, at what point did you think I gave a shit about what other people find entertaining?  It doesn't matter to me if someone can spend 4 hours a day playing cooking mama.  What I'm saying is that out of all the gamers I know, I'm the only one even moderately entertained by that game, and believe it or not, I'm the most open minded of my friends in terms of video games.  \"People play video games to be entertained,\" why the hell else would they play them?

These services arose around the same time, with Steam going to public beta months before, as I said above. They were developed independently and neither is a copy of the other, but since they provide the same type of service they are valid to compare.*\r\n\r\nThe Steam beta came out after live, and Live was out before steam.

I hate the reliability of the 360 and I prefer the blu ray drive of a PS3. I have plenty of problems with the 360 as no system is perfect and I have repeatedly stated that, proving me not to be a fanboy. \r\n\r\nYou are only calling me a fanboy because I defended live when I have just complained about the console and I previously repeatedly stated the 360 wasn't the best. I like live and I think it's good, but that doesn't mean I swallow MS cock. The 360 has some horrible problems outside of live you know. If WoW is the same then people can't say the PC is better as it has multiple instances of the same system - WoW isn't the only MMORPG pulling this shit. EvE, Everquest and more all have the same model. Live is no better or worse than a major MMO. The PC is not superior, it is just far more diverse. That's good and bad in different ways.\r\n\r\nYou will call anybody a fanboy if they don't agree that the PC online service is the best. Just because I don't agree doesn't make me a gibbering fanboy loon so stop with those lies.

It has a subpar gpu(a crippled nvidia 7800) which is inferior to the gpu of the 360.

The intented the ps3 to have 2 cell cpus and in the \"last minute\", they realise how bad decision that would be and cut a deal with nvidia to use their gpu.\n\nCan you imagine a ps3 with 2 cell cpus? How hard would that be to develop games for? How good would the performance be? How different\/strange the games would look? In this day, when all the games come out in all platforms, you need to have an easy to develop console.\n\nBut the cell cpu isnt really utilised because of the pc centric design of the games. The cell doesnt help as much as sony wanted in the graphics department. There isnt a ps3 single game that has superior to the 360 graphics. And multiplatform games perform better with better graphics on the 360(arguably because the 360 is the main console for development atm but even this is sony's fault because they delayed the ps3 due to the bluray).\n\nAs for the whole 10 year thing on the ps3, it is laughable. Hardware evolves so fast, 10 years is an insane amount of time. Sure, the ps2 will last 10 years, but there arent that many ps2 games released in the last 3-4 years of that decade.\n\nSony willingly sacrificed their console market share in order to promote bluray.","c079iuf":"i'm personally not angry (own a ps3) because i didn't care so much for GTA 4\n\nthe fallout 3 dlc however gets me really riled up cause fallout 3 was an amazing game","c079j38":"yep, that seems to be the only issue that ever happens with ps3s.

The real downside is a lot of pc gamers are savvy enough to pirate their shit, and only a minority of those are careful enough to not d\/l stuff that likely has viruses. Whereas the latest playstation is apparently ridiculously unhackable and as far as I know the only hack for the 360 burns out your laser super fast since its already a machine that runs hot anyway game developers have a safer bet in consoles. Especially now that console graphics look good enough to catch peoples attention. If its a console only release then they pick up customers from that. But with pc games you know that at some point, your gonna be able to get it for free. Certainly many good titles still come out on pc but since its not a golden goose then attention will be spent elsewhere. That, coupled with the unique drawing to a m\/k control set-up and a need to be somewhat tech savvy just makes computers a smaller niche of the market then other areas in which developers might make money.

","c07dq97":"I was thinking of buying a cheap 22\" 1080p monitor off newegg for my ps3, but I didn't buy one.

She's easily my best friend in the whole world. When we first got together, before even living together, I bought a whole new entertainment setup, new stand, plasma tv, ps3, the whole she-bang. Unfortunately I didn't have time that morning to put it all together before work, but when I came home, she had stayed all day and put everything together for me. I knew then that she was keeper.\n\nSince then we've spent nearly every evening doing something together. We watch movies, play video games, and once in a while just talk for hours. Our latest gig is World of Warcraft, and the only reason we're so addicted is because we play together, and do everything in game together, because after we play, we can geek out together about it.\n\nWe make breakfast for each other on the weekends, we go grocery shopping together every saturday, do laundry on sunday, and when I have class work to do, she keeps herself busy, and even helps me if I need a creative opinion.\n\nOur relationship is the best thing that's ever happened to me. We've been through rough times, and even when its looked pretty grim, we hold each other up and trudge through the crap. Every time we've come out on the other side better for it, and I'll happily hold her up for the rest of our lives.","c07fh54":"I don't understand why people do this?  what's the upside to installing *nix on your ps3?  especially if it's a crippled version of the os?","c07foz7":"On the [download page](http:\/\/dpadhero.com\/Download.html), they do recommend playing with a controller.

hype (and marketing campaigns) back then and much more publishers around and thus it was a lot more difficult and rather rare to have excelling scores (like for instance an average rating of 95%). It also was not common to enforce boycotts on industry mags for negative reviews. I guess in today times, most magazines simply can't afford to not have support by the few publishers that are left and game developers, that often impose or threaten to impose media boycotts, if ratings are not working out to their expectations, I guess this is a symptom that results from the high budgets involved, interest overlaps (as game mag staff tends to fill PR \/ Community functions at game studios \/ publishers) and the reliance of game mags on filling material  as previews, DEV diaries, DEV interviews and development updates (Which seems to be more important than updates in other industries, i.E. music \/ TV movies). \n\nAside of that, metacritic user rating is pretty much skewed for the most prominent titles because of the ps3\/xbox360 fanboy rating wars. (This also comes from PS3 fanboys and is not exclusively limited to xbox360 fanboys) Which is retarded and something that mature wise belongs to a elementary school yard. I wouldn't be surprised though, if PS3\/XBOX360 industry officials are playing their part in pushing masses to hunt down and be vocal about the competition's products.","c07jsxi":"i would say xbox360 and ps3 owners should be jealous of the pc gamers that have the game because of the mods and different things that can be done with the pc version of the game","c07jsyd":"i'm a ps3 gta4 owner (picked it up at a bbv 14.99 b1g1) and i'm not jealous or angry, because, quite frankly, i didn't think gta4 was that good of a game\n\nbut the fallout 3 dlc however.....","c07jtv9":"Because I REALLY think the ps3 needs to tell me how many unread messages I have every time i log in.

In college I was living in a slum building owned by my uncles.  I think I was paying them about $200 a month.  The building had four units, and before I moved in a hooker had lived in mine.

I filled my goldfish tank with it and he died in 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nThere were so many roaches in this place that they would crawl all over the walls.  I'd shake my shower curtain and 20 or 30 would fall off.  I fumigated the hell out of the place and took a nap, not realizing I was supposed to not be there for 48 hours.  At the hight of roach infestation I woke up with one on my fucking face.\r\n\r\nMy one neighbor would dump his trash in the hall.  Since I was landlord (didn't know how to fix a thing) it was my job to find out who was doing it.  I went through the trash and found *human shit* in it.  When I confronted the guy with a shit-smeared receipt with his name on it he pointed out that the government was framing him.\r\n\r\nMy other neightbors (drug dealers) would climb out of their bedroom window and across to mine to steal stuff every day when I went to school.  They stole everything, a hammer, my computer chair, playstation, cash.  I found all this stuff *in* their apartment.  I'd come home, go to watch a movie on my vcr, and suddenly notcie my vcr was gone.  My uncle's suggestion to this security breach was for me to sit out in the hall in my recovered computer chair, and casually wave a revolver around when the drug-dealers came home.  The cops, when I called them, suggested I don't do anything at all or the dealers would probably jump me.\r\n\r\nThe heater was centrally controlled by uncles to save money.  It was set somewhere in the 50's.  I learned that if you put a bag of ice over the thermostat it would keep it on.

Given the history of expiring lasers in PS2s, this is a huge benefit.\n- Once modded, doing similar mods in the future is a cakewalk using HDLoader (and the built in ftp on later versions). Plug in your memory card and their card, boot into HDLoader, and download your files, replace the TITLE.DB with the ID for their trigger disk, and upload to MC 2.

The DVD is the worst part of the 360, everything else is incredibly well balanced.  If you start running into bottlenecks on the 360, you usually have plenty of trade off options.

C is much better supported in this area, so if you want this to be painless, you'll have to have your API be C-compatible. If you want to test your functions from higher level languages (and you probably do), this means that just about all functions should be extern \"C\".\n\nOnce you do this, there is little point in using C++. Sure, you might use STL inside your functions, but what if someone wants to pass data in? What format do they use? You can't use STL with the C ABI, so you'll end up using a library like glib for those data structures. Then you're using two data structure libraries. For consistency, you'll avoid STL as much as you can. \n\nEventually the impedance mismatch between C API and C++ inside functions makes your code be almost pure C. Then you're using C++ as a \"slightly better C\". However, it is not a better C. C++ makes you type all kinds of unnecessary stuff, like casts for void pointers and extern \"C\" everywhere. It doesn't support all C99 features. It doesn't add much in the way of C ABI compatible features, so there isn't a big incentive to stay with C++ either. And if you publish your code, you'll also have to be good at ignoring people who tell you that \"don't use C++ as a better C!\" and \"you should use static_cast&lt;int\\*&gt;() instead of (int\\*) since it's more painful and casting should be as painful as possible!\". It ain't worth it.\n\nOf course, if you fully embrace all the 90's retroness of the C++ experience and don't write most of your code in higher level languages, then the above doesn't apply. But why would you choose C++ as the sole language for your new project in 2009?

Why would you develop for a platform lacking these tools first? Nobody does, unless you are making an exclusive ps3 game.\n\nIt's not like I'm saying that development *starts* for the ps3 late in the game. The ps3 is accounted for in the engine design process. The engine is initially implemented for all platforms at least to the proof-of-concept stage. However, when production begins the ps3 takes a back seat while the xbox 360 continues to be optimized so that production remains efficient. At my current studio, we just maintained a ps3 build in cruise control to make sure it still compiled. We also had one graphics programmer spend a (small) portion of his time maintaining the ps3 build. The project I worked on before this was similar. The project before *that*, we did nothing to maintain the ps3. 2\/3 of the way through development we farmed out the ps3 build to another studio (man, it must have sucked to be them). I also have several friends at other game studios and the best I've ever heard of is 1 dedicated programmer assigned to making sure the game runs on the ps3 and a system of rolling off programmers onto ps3 optimization as features were locked down in late development.\n\nFor the last two projects the ps3 has turned into a nightmare at the end, with too much to do in too little time. We fire up the ps3 to realize that the frame rate is abysmal and there are several huge issues to contend with. We try to push as much as we can onto the SPUs, etc. but its hard to get creative so late in development. Things get hacked up beyond recognition and we cut every corner possible because we don't have the time to do it right.\n\nTo avoid all the heartache you probably *should* develop for the ps3 first, but it's hardly realistic. You don't want to be battling the hardware while trying to get new features in for immediate consumption by the artists.","c07z9uh":"&gt;Nobody does, unless you are making an exclusive ps3 game.\n\nSaying it again won't make it true. It's not like it matters fuck all to me or anyone playing games, but multi-platform games have been developed with PS3 as a lead platform **and** as recently as last week Dave Perry said that you should lead on PS3 specifically because it was more difficult and that if you can get something to run on PS3 you know you'll get it to work on 360. Argue with him, not me, but you can't argue with the fact that some multi-platform games have begun to use the PS3 as a lead platform.","c07zh9e":"True, but the 360 has been out for a while.   Microsoft can now start working on the xbox500 (or whatever they can it), and have something that blows the ps3 away just because there is newer technology that the ps3 couldn't get.  Because the xbox is generally mainstream-ish hardware there are other elements of scale that help make it cheaper.  \n\nSony could well end up with the ps3 which is slower than the next xbox, harder to program, and just as expensive.   Of course this is a game of one-upmanship.  They can build the ps4, but will they make the same mistakes?

The difficulty of course is figuring out how to parallelize graphics computations.  That's basically the point.\n\n\nAs for the seeing an improvement:\n\n&gt; Where as the first game sported nice textures, this one seems to be leagues ahead of the original. And then there are the animations, which still have work left, but also look marvelous. When I walked away from the game I had no doubt in my mind that Uncharted 2 is without question the best looking title in development right now, and not just for the PlayStation 3, that includes the Xbox 360. People have been making many \"Crysis\" comparisons in the past with the original Uncharted, Gears of War 2, and Killzone 2, but none of them held a candle to Crytek's behemoth. And that's where Uncharted 2 comes in as the first console game that is truly worthy of the comparison. It's powerful stuff, folks.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.psxextreme.com\/ps3-previews\/289.html\n\n\n&gt; Also bear in mind that Naughty Dog are a Sony second party developer, which means of course they are going to say nice things about Sony\n\nIt's not just Naughty Dog who made these sort of comments:\n\n&gt; We've got games coming out now where we feel we've hit maybe 20 per cent of the potential of PlayStation 3. We know the power's there, but like any new platform it's going to take us a little bit of time to unleash it.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.thinkdigit.com\/forum\/showthread.php?t=43250 (original link is down)\n\n\nEither way, amount of processing power used is a poor metric for quality.  I used it to illustrate amount of *unrealized potential*.  I can easily write an application that uses 100% of PC's CPU.  But that doesn't mean it's any good, especially if the same task can be accomplished more efficiently (less memory, less CPU cycles).  And this sort of optimization usually takes a while to figure out on a new platform.\n\n\n&gt; As for \"not seeing anything groundbreaking on the 360 soon\", I think you'd be surprised. Developers have had a few years now to learn the intricacies of the architecture and can start developing optimised shaders and other pipelines, as well as now being able to dedicate engineers to tools programming enabling designers and artists to create more and better content. Conversely on the PS3 developers are still struggling to understand the architecture on a basic level, and haven't yet been able to reach the same level of iteration that 360 developers are able to achieve.\n\nI'm going to have to disagree with you completely here, unless you can show me a solid example of a forthcoming, groundbreaking 360 exclusive.","c07zinv":"What has being difficult to develop for have to do with sales of the console!?\n\nThe article is saying that because the console has sold less developers won't put more effort into ps3 games.

In a way it's just playing with the definition, but what's interesting is the actual things that are at issue (and not the fact that they are at issue).\n\n- He sees a \"programming language\" as separate from its implementation, but then argues that maybe they should be considered together, since good implementations matter a more to people than good designs.\n\n- Along these lines is the idea of the \"intended style of usage\" - this is what really struck me.  It's not specified in the grammar of the language or the semantics, but he's saying it is part of the language. To me, it's like an oral tradition, that an archaeologist might miss if only seeing the artifacts and what was written.  So in Java there are design patterns, and in C there are for loop idioms, in Fortran there are one letter variables, and so on.\n\n- He doesn't mention libraries, but surely the same reasoning applies.  Is it part of the language?  Java's libraries are. C's standard library should be.  Perhaps we should also include all the libraries available for it (open and closed) - 3rd party libraries are certainly a factor in choosing a language.  Along these lines, perhaps all applications that run on Windows applications should be considered part of Windows; and all playstation games part of the console. (The closest he comes to mentioning libraries is in the semantic section, where postscript can draw curves, but interpress can't - sort of \"built-in functions\" or operators).\n\nIn your list, only readability and power are purely the core language; ease-of-use is in combination with implementation; speed is mostly implementation; library is implementation; and support is organizational.\n\n\nI agree that your list is pretty much the important things - what's interesting for would-be programming language designers it that the core language does not seem to be all that important!\n","c07zmry":"I agree completely, I was always a sony fanboy because that's where the games were.

I believe the AI clock is what will discern the harmless bots from the most dangerous. In the first International Robot War (IRW) our hope will seem bleak but we will ultimately prevail. It was a swift defeat, but incredibly scary nonetheless. Our greatest weapons will be a sort of EMP \"special\" shrapnel bomb, filled with 25,000 mass produced nano-shrapnel (things called aggregated nano-rods, composed of layers of pointed \"rods\" increasing in size 25nm to 750nm to form a smaller stretched diamond shape) and incendiary charges followed by a protected EMPPE (slang is \"empey\" or an EMP Pulse Emitter composed of several common machine components and a simple breaking circuitry [nano super-transformers and the like] charge), a common blueprint on the \"new\" internet system of the time).

We will have to see what it is most in resemblance to on Earth. It would be awesome if they were something we don't know of, very simple, and it resembled some of our earliest beings. I read an an abstract a while back about environments of comets and their plasma and the replication\/manipulation of certain molecular structures in a it.. sounds pretty neat.

That's just stupid.\n\nIf the 360's  X-Box button \"doesn't count\" then it *isn't* a significant change from the original X-Box. This undermines your argument about the ps3 controller.\n\nAre you really saying that the ps2 controller is functionally indistinguishable from the ps3?

Just because it isn't a \"jump\" button doesn't mean it doesn't have functionality, and it certainly gets more use than the 64's L bumper or even the NES's select.\n\n* The PS3's motion sensitivity is an upgrade in functionality **greater than** the X-Box simply migrating the black and white buttons to the shoulders. If the 360 deserves a mention, so does the PS3.\n\n* My jab at Wii mote was meant to be funny. The motion sensor *is* progressive, but the ergonomic design is poor and the controller lacks an adequate number of buttons for many games (requiring you to hold down A+B while shaking instead just pressing a different button).

They are ready to be fully tested for any remaining bugs.\n\n\n**RC-#**: All known bugs are fixed or waived.  The game is ready for a retest.  If bugs are found, they are fixed for another RC - # goes up by 1.  If it tests clean, it's burned onto a physical disk and sent off to Sony\/MS\/etc for certification.\n\n\nAlpha\/Beta milestones do greatly vary between development houses.  In some places, the game will be declared as Alpha\/Beta even though it doesn't meet the requirements.  You will sometimes hear people talking about a \"soft beta\" or a \"true beta\" which would be opposite ends of the spectrum of betas.  RC almost always refers to a build that, if approved by internal QA, will be sent off for final certification by the platform manufacturer's certification labs or 3rd party contractors.\n\n\nAs far as these \"Open Betas\" are concerned...  All of those highly polished betas out there *are* technically betas, but they are not early betas.

Major pc hardware circles go like this\n\np4(northwood b)+9700 (against ps2\/xbox) = 2002\n\nc2d+8800 (against ps3\/xbox 360) = 2006\n\nNow we are waiting for the next circle of hardware(2010 maybe 2011?). The cpu will probably be an i7(but there will be cheaper models with cheaper mobos\/ram) and the successor of 200 series of nvidia(or the successor of ati's r700) and they will compete against ps4 and the next xbox(720?).\n\n99% of the current games dont use more than 2 cores. But what if you want to play a game that can use 4 cores? You can still play it, but your gpu will be bottlenecked by the cpu. As i said, there is a 3core trend which derives from the xbox 360. I think getting a cheap 4core and overclocking it is probably the best choice atm. \n\nBuying a used cpu is a good idea. Many people are ditching their c2q in order to get i7 atm, so you can find c2q easily and fairly cheaply. You can get high end c2q\/mobos\/ram used combos for very few money. Getting a q9xxx cpu+mobo for 250euros is a really good deal. Then just buy the rest of the components separately, assemble the pc and voila.\n\nI wouldnt worry too much about designing a pc that will last a long time. Just get the best value for money hardware atm. Being mid circle means that your hardware will probably become obsolete a bit faster than usual and spending extra money to buy something that is 10% faster now, wont make any difference in 3 years time. So just buy value for money, save money and when needed just buy a new pc.\n\nPS Generally you must avoid to be cpu bottlenecked because most games have plenty of options to downscale gpu load, they dont have many options to downscale cpu load. So if you are cpu bottlenecked, the game might become unplayable, even with all the settings set at lowest level.

Internet forums and gaming sites aside, out in the REAL WORLD, people i meet, people i work with, people i go to school with and xbox's GENERAL audience are obsessed with any game with a gun in it.  Rpgs sell bad on 360 because 360 is filled with jock gamers, and some hardcore gamers. rpgs on 360 go completely overlooked.  No one i work with even heard of Star ocean 4, yet they will talk to you for hours about their kill streaks in call of duty. What a waste for Star ocean 4...  Mistwalker never released their 3rd game for xbox due to lousy sales of what looked like great rpgs that any ps3 fan would have been happy to play (Lost Odyssey, anyone?)

I'll admit that i was pissed so i was ranting.\n\nYou dont like rpgs, so the fuck what?  Many people still do like rpgs that doesnt make you any better than anyone else and your view on the ps3 is still completely ignorant.  Halo is a piece of shit and \"pop\" culture is just that, pop, and no one gives a fuck about cookie cutter conformist bullshit like that, at least anyone who can think for themselves.\n\nGranted rpgs can be cliche, but not all rpgs are good rpgs.  To bitch about rpgs the way you do is like bitching about first person shooters and how in every FPS game, its First person, you aim, and you shoot.  FPS follow their formula and rpgs follow theirs and if you don't like it then its your problem.\n\nAs i said before, rpgs, like any other genres are littered with cliches.  Halo is a walking cliche of the gaming \"pop culture\" that i've grown to despise as they buy into stupid hype over sub par games because they just don't know any better, and they don't know any better because they were never gamers until it was made popular by xbox, and ushered in people who dont know a fucking thing about gaming, yet desire strongly to be a leading voice in their newly obtained hobby, so they go around ignorantly running their mouths and and everyone just jumps on the bandwagon, because thats what everyone else is saying.\nThe fact that  halo was getting its massive popularity that is proof, as that popularity  should belong to something more like portal, or half life, something thats actually GOOD.\n\n  You don't hear very many people talk about THOSE games, unless they actually have refined taste and most people i speak to who play 360 dont.\n\nNote im not talking about people online but people in real life, average every day people who never gamed before it became the next big thing in the retarded pop culture which is naturally filled with morons who can only follow.\n\nYes, i do watch anime but im hardly a \"japanophile\"  and what it comes down to is the fact that you just feel that your superior because i enjoy things like anime and rpgs.  I dont pretend to be japanese, im not obsessed with anime and now YOUR the one jumping to conclusions.\n\nI judged you as a 360 fanboy because you only hear this ignorant \"anyone who plays jrpgs and likes anime are faggy japanophiles\" kind of talk from them, and other closed minded pricks.  That line of logic shone through in your original post and yes, i DO take offense when someone blatantly insults things that are my hobbies and are signifigant to me.\n\nI was never bashing the 360  I have NO ISSUE with microsoft, or the 360, but since you insisted upon throwing a bunch of stupid lies about the ps3 like not having any good games or install base, i thought i might as well list the 360s ACTUAL PROBLEMS.  NO i wasn't thinking of the ps2.  Ps3 is only somewhat unpopular here because 360 is now the majority of PEOPLE PLAYING GAMES, (but NOT GAMERS.) due to xbox hype by the pop culture who know NOTHING about games.What i hate about the 360 is the massive hordes of completely ignorant shit heads like you who take it upon themselves to look down on others due to their lack of understanding for the genres they condemn with such a passion.\n\nNice, telling me to get a life thats a good one. Normally it was the jocks or the \"cool\" guys who would always say that to us gamers, and now its at this point where people cant even talk about, and then defend(due to retarded statements like yours) their console or their genres without ignorant closed minded opposition, which seems to come from most 360 players because they feel so mighty for some reason.\n\nGo ahead and think what you want about anime, and about jrpgs.  You lack the capacity to enjoy them for what they are, and thats no reason to condemn those who dont.\n\nThe ps3 doesn't nearly have as many quality titles as 360 does? It Doesnt have a decent install base?  Complete and utter 360 fanboy propaganda. \n\nIm not denying 360's superiority with the POP CULTURE in THIS COUNTRY (which is fucking retarded in the first place) but to say that the ps3 is a BAD console, and then continue to spew that retarded propaganda about how 360 is better because jocks and frat boys now call it home is completely ignorant.\n\nIm sure you've heard of Halo Wars?  Well maybe then you might be aware of the fact that as an RTS its a fucking joke, its a dumbed down piece of crap they made to try and bring all the new gamers into something other than FPS, which is why they get the simple watered down version of an attempt of RTS.  Thats the Halo series shining for you and all you xbox jackoffs who cant get the fuck over themselves.\n\nThe fact that they have to release dumbed down RTS games in the consoles most popular and best selling series (which created xbox's popularity in the first place...) just proves my point about the majority of people who play 360.\n\nAlso nice, calling out my grammar errors, it just goes to show me that your willing to cling to any reason to convince yourself of superiority.

Maybe you don't realize that much of that information regarding a \"lack of quality titles\" is completely untrue.  As I have said before, most games that matter are multiplatform anyway and to argue that they are \"superior\" on 360 is just biased opinion.  How exactly are they superior?  We can run through some possibilities:\n\nGranted; there is a larger online audience, and a much more established community for online games.  This is a plus, and I cannot deny this because after all, it is a pop culture device.  The problem I see in this is all the racist and ignorant bigotry that is spewed forth from 360 players on their headsets while playing there games, which further proves my point of how most people on 360 are just tasteless and unrefined.  I would want no part in a community like that in the first place, and I can safely say that this type of trash is highly lacking on the ps3, and I would know, as I buy all the leading multiplatform games, and the exclusives.\n\nHow else is it superior?\n\nI would say that the fact that the 360 is prone to freezing and dying all the time is a HUGE factor you should consider when arguing console quality.\n\nSo far I see a shitty community filled with bigots, racists and mouthy teenagers and that just doesn't sound at all appealing.  If you didn't know, the 360 DOES have a reputation for this.  \n\nSales do NOT make a console superior, after all the Wii outsells both, but does that make the wii better?  Not even close.\n\nAlthough I cannot deny the validity of many of your points, many of your other points really do seem to stem from misinformed biased information.\n\ngranted the 360 may get some DLC over the ps3 as far as GTA is concerned, but the ps3 also receives DLC that is not available on the 360.  I think this is pretty retarded, but since microsoft decided to rely on massive amounts of cash to buy exclusive rights for dlc that would normally be multiplatform anyway, the ps3 has also started doing this.\n\nIt definitely doesn't have any graphical improvements, and technically speaking although it may be minor and barely noticable at best, also depending on the game and what dev kit was used, what system it was originally developed for, ps3 has HIGHER graphic capabilities over the 360 so you cant argue that as superior either.\n\nNow lets talk about HD gaming.  I have a nice big 42 inch lcd which goes amazingly great with my ps3.  Never have I seen such amazing graphics in such an epic scale.  360 is capable of this, but not without the purchasing of upgrades, when at a certain time after the ps3 dropped to 400 dollars, to get the same capabilities out of 360, it would end up costing you slightly MORE than a ps3 to be able to do what a ps3 can do by default.\n\nI wish you WOULD argue that point to me, but to be honest it doesn't seem there is anything valid you can actually point out.\n\nYou are correct, Sony did make mistakes in the beginning, but I'm surprised you don't know this since you proclaim yourself so mightily as being further \"in the know\" than me when it comes to these consoles, but ps3 sales are growing more and more.  People are still buying them, but not like the wii (for kids and casuals) and not like the 360 (jocky teens, frat boys, a large number of IMO non gamers)\n\nIf you recall the same was said about the ps2. I was condemned for buying a ps2 just as I was for ps3 by my own friends, and yet it turned out to be the best console ever made with the longest lifespan of any console, AND the largest library of games on any console to my knowledge and they had a bad start as well.\n\nMetal gear solid was a good game for console sales, LBP could have been better, but I'm sure that helped.  Admittedly it didn't move consoles like sony predicted, but I never expected it to.  Then you have God of war 3 which will most likely move some consoles as well.  The ps3 behemoth is moving slowly, like the ps2 did at first, but its still moving none the less and its getting bigger, not smaller.  Look it up.  Im not talking about competing sales with 360, but sales in general are rising and continue to rise on a yearly basis.\n\nI currently have 18 ps3 games.  I would love for you to tell me how these games are classified as inferior compared to what 360 has to offer.\n\nMetal Gear Solid 4,\n Street Fighter 4,\n Devil May Cry 4,\n Grand Theft Auto 4,\n Soul Calibur 4 (thats how the game spells it..)\n Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion,\n Resident Evil 5,\n Genji days of the blade (yeah this game blows, but it was the only game i could afford when i bought my ps3 as it was the cheapest one so yeah...)\n Disgaea 3,\n Call of Duty 5,\n Uncharted Drake's Fortune,\n Little Big Planet,\n Ninja Gaiden Sigma,\n Resistance fall of man,\n Condemned 2,\n Guitar Hero World Tour,\n Mirror's Edge,\n Silent Hill Homecomming.  \n\nHow does this point to you as an inferior lineup of games?  Most of these games are great, and notice all the sequels (waaay too many 4's...) that should tell you that ps3 is receiving the same type of content the ps2 did, its doing the same as its always done before, and i don't believe im missing MUCH without having a 360 (which I wouldn't mind owning for the few exclusives that interest me, and I do mean FEW)\n\nSo to recap, yes the 360 is more popular, it has sold more, but that's because its pop culture and that to me isn't a good thing because it turned the online community into a clusterfuck of raging teens and adults.\n\n360 is unreliable as far as it lasting.  They break down and freeze, they have less graphical capabilities than the ps3, or just capabilities in general, you have to upgrade to get high def gaming out of it, which would have cost more than the ps3 when it was 400 dollars, most of the exclusives are sub par clones of sub par games that came before them which are heralded as greatness by unrefined pop culture.  I would like Gears of war, the rpgs, and maybe a few other titles I may have missed, but most of it doesn't look promising when i check out the 360 section at my local game stop.\n\nI hope that I have shown you that in at least ONE regard, you are just being biased which is understandable, as that is human nature when it comes to arguing your preferences for one reason or another.\n\nHalo wars may be a solid game, but that doesn't mean it isn't an insult to RTS, however, another RTS has come out on 360 which claims to fill in the gaps of Halo Wars, which is fine in my book.  Don't know if Endwar is multiplatform as that is another rts, although admittedly I don't know much about that one.\n\nRTS would be greatly improved on consoles of they used cursors.  You could use an analog stick or just buy a mouse for your console.  That right there would solve many console RTS problems in one shot, and gives you much much more freedom to make an in depth and technical RTS game.\n\nI believe that there really isn't anything left for me to say, and I'm really not out to change your mind, I just like to argue in general but this one has ran its course.\n\nDespite the fact that your a complete stranger who doesn't mean anything to me, just some random opponent on a trite internet argument, I have taken the time to proof read numerous times to pick up on any errors I may have made, just for you big guy.\n\nI hope now you can try and take my views and opinions a little more seriously now that I have capitalized all my i's (oops, missed one) and applied as many grammatically correct characters that my ability and my patience in skimming over all this text to a stranger who doesn't matter will allow.\n\nAnyway, just keep gaming because that's the important thing and take care.\n\nOh and one more thing about your comparison videos statement:  I have looked at comparison videos, for assassins creed and gta4 specifically.  Admittedly that isnt a lot, but i don't actually LOOK for them so yeah.  In GTA4's case, there were only minor graphical differences you could phase out by changing your tv settings such as color and contrast, ect..\n\nAs for the Assassins Creed comparison videos as well as other retarded comparison videos, those results are slanted as the ps3 versions NEVER have FULL HDMI activated, its left on limited, which is the default setting.  You must change this to full for an accurate comparison as far as graphics go, but these people who do these comparison videos (most likely 360 owners who want to feel more superior than their ps3 counterpart)purposely leave the ps3's high def settings on the lowest settings, or they don't know they need to optimize their ps3 display, and there have been many videos and articles about this very issue.\n\nIf your referring to graphical or gameplay glitches between the two consoles, this could be said for both consoles. It depends which console the game was originally developed for, and the porting over between two different machine may cause this to happen.  The same can be said with 360 games.  Please note that in ALL of the games that I listed above, I have seen nothing of the sort, leaving me to believe its only a small problem with a small amount of games, and\/or there so insignificant that most people don't even notice them in the first place.\n\nThat is all","c08npj4":"Interesting...

The Wii with its 49.99 peripherals and novelty games raises the total cost of ownership over the other units.

Accusations of media bias, again?\n\nI direct your attention to [this](http:\/\/faculty.chass.ncsu.edu\/cobb\/p_courses\/ps411\/assigned%20readings\/dalessio_meta%20analyses%20media%20bias.pdf). It's a meta-analysis of a number of peer-reviewed journalism studies, and while it's slightly out of date, the primary shift in media coverage since 2000 has been the polarization of Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nSome choice quotes:\n\n&gt;This contradictory set of findings suggests the subjective nature of bias, that it is a perception rather than a matter of objective agreement. This was demonstrated objectively by Stevenson and Greene. *(this in regards to the liberal perception of conservative bias and vice versa)*.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt; On the whole, no significant biases were found for the newspaper industry. Biases in newsmagazines were virtually zero as well. However, meta-analysis of sutdies of television network news showed small, measurable, but probably insubstantial coverage and statement biases.\n\nAnd now to return to the article at hand:\n\n&gt;It is undeniable that the U.S. elite media -- what both liberals and conservatives sometimes call the \"mainstream media,\" or MSM -- skews to the left.\n\nI, and most of the scholarly work on the subject, disagree. The aggregate of media coverage is fairly neutral, but ideologues will always perceive bias against their ideology.\n\nIt's easy to find this stuff; almost laughably so. I don't even have to look further than Google to find evidence for my statements; the unnamed conservative is relying on \"what-if\" scenarios and appeals to emotion.

There are devices you can get to turn the mouse and keyboard signals into analog inputs for you, like the 360Sniper, but it's not great. Analog inputs have deadzones and such that basically kill the refined controls you get from a mouse. They also have a maximum input amount, where mice have no such thing.

It just has more FPS games, which I couldn't care less about.","c08wm0z":"LBP for ps3, obviously, rainbow 6 vegas 2 is good as well, but resistance 2 doesn't have a playable offline co-op due to class restraints, but that's as far as my ps3 offline stuff goes :)","c08wn6r":"i liked the twisted metal series as well, but i haven't heard of any games like it except for wipeout HD for the ps3 which is pretty close to the mario kart type, and burnout paradise, which isn't totally like either of them, but it's a very fun racing game where you can crash other cars, so it's kind of inbetween the pure racing and the battle racing genres\n\nWipeout HD and burnout paradise are both $20 (wipeout is a psn only title, but burnout can be disk or online download) but unfortunately, burnout paradise doesn't have split-screen.  Fortunately, wipeout does have splitscreen","c08wnlx":"excellent comment.\n\ni totally agree with you that this generation has mostly only concentrated on shooters. \n\ni bought a PS3 because i figured that this generation would be the same as the last one. nintendo for nintendo games, playstation for variety, and xbox for online shooters. i wanted variety but most software houses have abandoned sony for the wii and 360. \n\nnow i'm at home playing killzone and loving it. i just wish i had the same amount of choice i had with my ps2.

It's now just the inconvenience of if it happens.  Two of my friends RRoD and they had their console back in a couple weeks I think, maybe less. \n\nSony also isn't perfect - overheated ps3s have YLoD but, a lot of that was due to user error not keeping ventilation for it.  \n\n\nHonestly, the best answer I can give is to pick the one which you like exclusives better on.  I prefer UT3 to Gears and I'm not a Halo fan. I also wanted to play Resistance 2, Killzone 2, and the new God of War (I went for LBP too just for a change) so naturally I went PS3.  But, if you like 360 exclusives go that route. And don't listen to anyone claiming larger libraries, etc.  I've yet to have a hard time finding a good game to play and neither has my friend who owns a 360.  90% of games come out on both.

I use it a lot as a media server (have it connected to an external hard drive, mouse and keyboard).  \n\n\nI'll be honest though, the ps3 game library isn't quite as good as the xbox 360 library.\n\n\nHowever (and I don't know if this applies to you), but it REALLY goes against my principles to pay for something that should be free.  I don't give in to nickle and diming very easily and the xbox really nickle and dimes you.

Neither is in a death spiral.\n\nAs i said, wii is in the first place and probably has higher profit margins than the rest of the consoles, so it doesnt really need a price cut. Ps3 on the other hand is losing badly for the reasons stated in the article(lower sales for multiplatform games, cheaper\/better bluray players and generally lower sales than competing consoles).","c08y1xg":"&gt; The total sales comparison of the top 10 games was a bit crappy but you cant deny the fact that Resident Evil 5 sold 50% more units on the 360 than on the ps3.

Do you suppose Capcom wishes at this point they hadn't developed the PS3 version and sold those half a million copies?\n\n(Also, it sold another 400k in Japan, where the 360 version only sold 100k)\n\n[Actually, when you look at _total_ sales, the PS3 version sold more overall.](http:\/\/vgchartz.com\/swlaunch.php?reg1=All&amp;game1=Resident+Evil+5+-+PS3&amp;reg2=All&amp;game2=Resident+Evil+5+-+X360&amp;reg3=All&amp;game3=&amp;weeks=100)","c08y221":"I am pretty sure that xbox 360 and ps3 are fighting over pretty much the same market. There is a very small chance that someone will buy both a ps3 and a 360. So if someone buys a ps3, he wont be buying a 360.\n\nSony sacrificed the ps3(it was delayed and is more expensive because of the bluray) in order to win the format war. Whether that was a wise choice, i dont know.\n\nPersonally I think online distribution will largely take over. Even an adsl connection is enough for HD content streaming(720p at least).","c08y25l":"Yes but not all developers have the money and the time in order to do a multiplatform game. Ps3 not only sells fewer copies but it is also harder to develop for. \n\nThis means that many developers will either make a game 360 exclusive or they will dedicate less time optimizing the ps3 version(and often the ps3 version will be largely based on the 360 version of the game).\n\nVgacharts isnt a reliable source IMO. And if you remove Japan from these stats(where ps3 sells significantly more than the 360 mostly for the reason that it's japanese and its brand value in that specific country), the stats will show the 360 dominating.","c08y2m8":"Neither will die of course since both have reached critical mass. But there was always an expectation that the ps3 will catch up or at least sell as many consoles as the 360, something which i dont think will happen.\n\nPs3 has got plenty of games now, it's been out for a long time, yet developers(to some extent) and consumers still prefer to avoid it. And what is worse is that sony doesnt look too keen on lower ps3's price.\n\nMaybe sony cant lower the cost of ps3 enough, maybe they arent willing to sacrifice their margins or maybe they want to protect the sales of their standalone bluray players(and they dont want the ps3 to compete against them). But things dont look good for the ps3.","c08y2sg":"If by death spiral you mean that it will soon die, then no, i dont think ps3 is in a death spiral. All 3 consoles have got enough critical mass to sustain their existence(and production of new games for them).\n\nBut the ps3 is definitely on a big downward spiral. It keeps selling less and less, even in Japan, while the 360's sales are kept constant(or rising, especially in Japan).\n\nPs3 really needs a pricecut.

Sure, 360 didnt have a much of a base in japan(so an increase in sales is easy). But the ps3 sells \"only\" twice as many consoles as the 360 in Japan, which is simply insane(considering Japan).\n\nThe most interesting data is the comparison between ps2 and ps3. The difference in sales between these 2 is insane. Sony pretty much gave up in this generation. Ps3 was sacrificed to the hd media gods. This gave the opportunity to microsoft to enter a market in which it had almost 0 share in previous gen.\n\nIf things are going that bad in Japan for the ps3, imagine how things are going elsewhere.","c08y42f":"2009 is only 3 months old so that doesnt mean much.

If I get a new computer, I want a Mac.\n\nBack when I was gaming on my PC, I got REALLY tired of having to upgrade my freakin video card and ram every time a new game came out. The last game I played on PC was Half Life 2. I spent a ton of money upgrading my computer to run the game, and it still ran like shit occasionally. I spent all this time tweaking my system so I could crank out a few more frames per second. I don't have that problem anymore with an XBox. No more tweaking. No more upgrading. No more headaches. Just straight gaming. Plus I get to view it on my nice big tv as opposed to my 22\" monitor.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, yes. A keyboard and mouse is a better combo for first person shooters.

I'd rather just play casually with like-minded friends these days.\n\n**EDIT\n\nI remembered another reason why I stopped gaming on PC. CHEATERS!! I remember how easy it was to cheat on those games on PC. I played Counter Strike for like a month before the wall-hackers and auto-aim folks came around.

You really, seriously call that \"very very limited\"?  Usually written on straight native code?  Having friends that work on games, I think you would be surprised at how they are developed.  Smart pointers are pretty common, as are things like scripting languages that manage memory for you.  Focus on the important parts of the system, find the easiest way to do the parts that are not.\n\nIf you were really concerned with memory consumption on an embedded system, you wouldn't be anywhere near C++ in the first place.  Simply linking with the standard c++ library will cost you way more memory than smart pointers.  If memory was a true challenge, your code would look completely different.  I have worked on motes, trust me, it is a completely different world.  It is also a world where your codebase is so tiny that the complexity problems you would solve with smart pointers simply don't exist.\n\nBasically, apply methodologies to the contexts that are suited to them.","c0919y8":"Wii is quite handily whooping the psp.

It has no 3d acceleration so any rendering would have to be done in software.  The XO does however have YUV overlays with colour subsampling. It would be possible to write a renderer that did a higher level of quality and resolution for the brightness information than for the colour.\n\nYou can actually cut corners quite impressively when doing things to the chrominance channels in YUV. Nearest neighbour colour may look reasonable if the brightness is ok.  \n\nAt a hardware level the same principle applies, just not on hardware designed for RGBA.  If someone were to design a graphics card that split the luminance and chrominance tasks it is conceivable that performance gains could be achieved by devoting more silicon to the luminance channel.  That silicon could be made available by cutting corners in the colour.  The simplest example of this would be to use and anisotropic texturing on luminance only.\n\nYou'd still have to do all(or at least most) of the geometry work, The gains would be pretty much restricted to fill rate.\n\nOf course it wouldn't ever get done in hardware,  even if it did bring significant performance gains, it would be at the cost of compatibility.  You'd have do a few things differently.  A console released around the era of the ps2 probably would have been the best window for such a technique.\n\nMaybe sometime in the future the window will open up again driven this time more by memory bandwidth.

There was a requirement to get significantly better at the game over time, to see the rest.  c.f. anything on the atari from pacman onwards, shoot'em-ups on early consoles like R-Type, and so on.\n\nWith the advent of the ps2 and particularly the xbox, games have featured a lower curve of skill required to complete, where simply investing time will get you through the game.  And once you're done, invest more time unlocking things that are obscure, rather than difficult.  Compare unlocks in games like Mario to ones in GTA.  Not knocking on GTA as it is fun, but once you master the controls, there's little of the game you can't achieve.\n\nPC gaming, being a lot broader, is the only area where such skill improvement is still required by some games (certainly not all) in order to proceed, and gives old gamers like me (and you, in theory) the same thrill that we got to level X because we're *good*, not because we're patient.\n\nAlso, the advent of the FPS and the RTS made mouse\/keyboard the preferred interface.

Which have looked nicer than the win32 gui for years. But those toolkits keep it portable.\n\n*java:*\nthey had their own incompatible version of the JRE, that had all these tie-ins with win32 api. However, that one is now gone, thanks to lawsuits by SUN.\n\n*.net:*\nthis one is more recent. pre-installed support for a bunch of programming languages and api's that are only going to be available on windows. Before .NET almost every programming language was cross-platform by nature. Their api's were available for all operating systems. Although I will admit that they made a very nice toolchain with .NET -&gt; at least this time it's coupled with innovation, although that has not been the incentive. How does microsoft make money on .NET? They don't. It's just there to lock people in. This one is also the least troublesome, because nobody in any way is forced to use .NET just seduced.\n\n*hardware:*\nsome of the leaked memo's that were brought up in the anti-trust case, specifically explained how microsoft forced hardware vendors to make the ACPI as hard as possible to support from another operating system. The price we all pay, still today, is that they made is so hard, the drivers even suck on windows at times. And certain use cases are just not possible because of this illogical and unneeded complexity.\n\n*filesystems:*\nThere are many filesystems out there, that are not patented by anyone. which code is available for commercial use. Many of them way superior to FAT or NTFS. I mean, these filesystems sucked so much, they invented a new word \"defragmentation\". But they are not supported on Windows, let alone used. Why? Because then your USB-stick wouldn't be formated as FAT or NTFS. They can then use the patents on FAT to prevent linux-friendly hardware vendors and linux-distrobutions from supporting things like USB sticks. Most recently they sued TomTom. The only reason they are not playing out this card towards the linux distorbutions at the moment is that the EU would likely fine the shit out of them for trying. Or IBM would start the nuclear patent war.\n\nYou may not have been around for all these developments. But these things are not 'accidents' .. or 'side-effects' of creating innovation.\n\nAlso, consider that Microsoft still doesn't ever made any money on the XBox. It's just there to kill off Sony and make that toolchain a lesser option.\n\nThen again, Sony aint no saint. They did the same to Nintendo. The original playstation also didn't make any money. It was just a make nintendo-go-away-strategy. And it almost worked too. The PS2 made them a lot of money. If it wasn't for the impossible success of the Wii, Nintendo would be bankrupts by now.\n\nThe thing is, almost 90% of all IT-innovation is not innovation, but just vendor-lockin strategies. The other 10% of IT-innovation is vendor-lockin strategy _using_ innovation.\n\nThe most simple example here, is that if you make a _popular_ game purely for Windows and the XBox, you don't have to pay liscence fees, otherwise you do.

Atheists will try to tell you there is no such thing as a force of Good or a force of Evil, they will try to say \"there is no God, no Devil, no angels, no demons, it's all a make-believe story..\"  I'm telling you the Truth here, it's not just a made up story, it's real.  Think about this: the forces of Good and Light want you to see and know what is really going on, the tactic of evil and darkness is to get you to disbelieve that there is an opposing force because if you don't believe that it exists then it can have total power over you and your life.  \n  \nOthers will try to over-complicate the supernatural, spiritual realm, it is very complicated when you get into the details, but for now you just need to at least have an open mind and see that there are other forces at work going on here.  \n    \nYou can see how your mother is being held captive by this substance, you can see how it changes her and turns her into a different person.

PlayStation 3 gets close - it's feature-complete (yes, it has Trophies to mirror Achievements), but it's let down a touch by the blurrier graphics. In most cases it manages to look approximate to the 360 game, but there are several shots where it can look pretty poor - the opening shot of Butcher Bay in particular stands out.\r\n\r\nthis tends to be the rule of thumb across multi platform console games. I especially like how the fact the ps3 has achievements in it is still considered a luxury. brilliant. \r\n\r\nlets just remind outselves the original article was about graphics fidelity, yeah. :)","c09uxnu":"Meh to ps3 exclusives.","c09uzel":"They said the same thing about the Xbox 360 against the ps3. I also find it hilarious how you're talking about 'last round of tests' like there was some grand scientific study done into it, what are you? A fanboy?\n\nContrary to popular belief apple does not make the superior product, they just do a better job advertising.","c09v5hf":"&gt;In school, we had this kid who called everyone 'gay'. Guess what he turned out to be.\n\nNo idea, but given I am a fairly successful person I don't care either ;)\n\nI don't call people of differing opinions fanboys, I call idiots who talk like morons fanboys because that is what they are.\n\nSo let me teach you a bit more about fanboys, as you clearly are one as well =)\n\nwickedsun is saying 'well Microsoft rushed the xbox 360 out and that is why it's ahead', he would no doubt also be the first to praise the ps2 as something awesome and talk about its sales figures or this or that, in typical fanboy fashion of course, now, do you know what Sony did? Yep, they 'rushed' the ps2 out.\n\nWhat wickedsun is doing is trying to say Microsoft somehow cheated hence the success of the xbox 360 simply doesn't count, of course in true fanboy fashion he is also a hypocrite.\n\nI hope you learned something today about what an idiot you are, now go back trying to explain to me how 'tests' proved your retarded opinion has merit, whatever those 'tests' are is up to your deluded mind to conjure up I guess. I just wonder if you're one of those exceptionally pathetic people who goes into my history and downmods everything they can find out of spite.","c09vfd0":"I had no problem getting xubuntu-ps3 9.04 to install recently. I did have bluetooth problems however. but it runs pretty nice. hardware acceleration would be nice though.","c09vjm2":"The new Sony Walkman killer is finally here.\n\nNot so smug now are you, ps3 fanboys?","c09vkgv":"Kind of like [this](http:\/\/www.instructables.com\/id\/Magnetic-Refrigerator-Lights\/) or [this?](http:\/\/gizmodo.com\/5098895\/lightning-review-touchcharge-wireless-charger-for-ps3-xbox-360-and-wii-controllers)","c09vnqy":"I don't know about you, but I for one would love to live in [Mirror's Edge](http:\/\/ps3media.ign.com\/ps3\/image\/article\/845\/845572\/mirrors-edge-20080115102316761.jpg).","c09vnte":"I was with a girl who would throw things when I wouldn't give in, and let her have her way. When I broke up with her,(for that reason) she took things too far by throwing a ps3 controller through my living room window. I called the police to avoid the violence I could see coming, and was almost arrested myself. The officer kept insinuating that **I** was the one who was out of control, and that I couldn't press charges without being arrested myself. I hadn't so much as raised my voice at her. She had gone on an insane rampage in my apartment, and I was the one who called the police. It's because of reactions like that of these police officers that some women feel untouchable.Especially once they know you aren't going to hit them back.","c09vtb5":"This might help: http:\/\/www.windowsnetworking.com\/nt\/registry\/rtips34.shtml","c09w0td":"Not gonna lie when I first heard the colonel say that, I thought my ps2 was overheating, and that was it's way of telling me to turn it off.","c09w1ll":"Looks like [this one](http:\/\/www.safes4you.com\/store\/handgun\/stackon\/ps514.html).  I didn't do any research before getting it, I just bought what they had in stock at Gander Mountain.","c09w3gr":"Not really.  The xbox360 might not be as good as a ps3, but everyone already has one.  It's easily the gaming system of choice.  ","c09w6l3":"&gt; xbox360 might not be as good as a ps3\r\n\r\nI am *tired of this canard*.  This idea is an utter falsehood.  It is a result of Sony's *usual* marketing; promise a revolutionary supercomputer-console.  But we know from the last two generations (did peopel forget?!) that it is simply untrue.\r\n\r\nBut, dont take my word for it.  How about from Dave Shippy?  Dave Shippy is;\r\n\r\n&gt; Shippy was the chief architect of the power processing unit for the Cell, and overall technical leader and architect for the team that created the Power Architecture-related microprocessors that ended up in both the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3\r\n\r\nAnd, [in this recent interview with Gamasutra](http:\/\/www.gamasutra.com\/view\/feature\/3904\/processing_the_truth_an_interview_.php?print=1) he laid Sony's nonsense bare.\r\n\r\n&gt; But can Shippy's insight on both console's processors finally answer the age-old debate about which console is actually more powerful? \r\n\r\n&gt; \"I'm going to have to answer with an 'it depends,'\" laughs Shippy, after a pause. \"Again, they're completely different models. So in the PS3, you've got this Cell chip which has massive parallel processing power, the PowerPC core, multiple SPU cores\u2026 it's got a GPU that is, in the model here, processing more in the Cell chip and less in the GPU. So that's one processing paradigm -- a heterogeneous paradigm.\" \r\n\r\n&gt; \"With the Xbox 360, you've got more of a traditional multi-core system, and you've got three PowerPC cores, each of them having dual threads -- so you've got six threads running there, at least in the CPU. Six threads in Xbox 360, and eight or nine threads in the PS3 -- but then you've got to factor in the GPU,\" Shippy explains. \"The GPU is highly sophisticated in the Xbox 360.\" \r\n\r\n&gt; He concludes: \"At the end of the day, when you put them all together, depending on the software, **I think they're pretty equal**, even though they're completely different processing models.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nENOUGH with this \"PS3 is more powerful than Xbox 360\" garbage.  Enough with the \"it will take time for the developers, then it will show its true power\".  Enough with the \"10 year life cycle\".","c09w93k":"Although it's not a forum, I usually go to ps3fanboy.com for all my news. I haven't been able to find a really good forum, I tried posting on the official PS forums for a while and they aren't so great.

The problems to overcome on XBox 360 are also very big, as competitive engines of other companies mature and will offer more polys and more content at a steadier framerate than Valve will be able to do, unless they keep up. The 360 also has a multi-core architecture which really has to be used to the max to stay competitive. The difference with the PS3 is that more can be offloaded to the GPU in shader form, while on the PS3 one typically uses the SPE's to offload stuff to instead of the GPU so higher throughput can be reached. \n\nThe silly thing is that Valve has a mature engine for years now, and the main advantage of using a mature engine is that you don't have to worry much about hardware specific aspects, as these are abstracted away from you by the engine. So the only thing Valve needs to do is make their engine work on PS3. After that they can basicly make any game on PS3 without more effort than they have to put into the 360 port (which isn't a recompile of the PC sourcecode if you think that). \n\nBecause they refuse to do that, they cripple themselves and the reasoning used is simply not logical: many aspects of an engine is written in C\/C++ code which runs on any CPU with a C\/C++ compiler. It's  not as if they have to rewrite the whole engine again for PS3. \n\nIn a year or so, the deferred shading pipeline developed by Sony R&amp;D and applied in the KZ2 and Uncharted engines for example (as well as infamous) will more and more mature and will make Sony games look much better than GPU shader only games on 360, IF the 360 developers aren't stepping up and move to similar rendering techniques, more parallelisation, offloading processes to CPU cores\/hw threads. Valve will then have a hard time keeping up, as SPE's used well are hard to beat with a typical GPU shader, even on 360. So this 'designer' in the article might now think he has it easy, but that's just a fallacy. The near future will bring engines to the table they have a hard time keeping up with if they don't step up. I.o.w.: they have to work hard to stay competitive, so not targeting PS3 because 'it's hard' is therefore nonsense, getting the SPE performance from a 360 cpu\/gpu tandem, THAT will be hard in the near future. \n\nSo, Valve has other reasons to ignore the ps3, one typically being that the founders of Valve typically still love the mothership they came from: Microsoft. That's OK though, it would be better if they just say so and not moan about things being difficult. Valve has some very clever programmers on board, there's not much too difficult for them. ","c0a6qww":"ps2 didn't have a cell but a custom made chip which wasn't re-usable in bulk form in a ps3, as the CELL was superior to it. ","c0a6sbt":"LOL, really?

Bearing in mind that you need to hit 400K to become a greatest hits title on the PS2, there are quite a few titles that fall into that category on the Wii already.\r\n\r\n4) The exact same can be said for Madworld (\"no one wants to play a weird art style beat 'em up thing\"). Thank you for establishing my original point.\r\n\r\n5) What 'real games' have died on it?\r\n\r\n6) And if Project Natal sells millions, then what? Does that make the 360 a kiddie console? And what happens if the PS3 ends up being a superior device (see: EA's comment about the 360 being maxed out)? Is the 360 no longer a serious console?\r\n\r\nAs I said, I like my 360 and Wii equally, but I'm not going to shoehorn a role for either console. When you play Fifa, for example, on the Wii versus on the 360, the Wii version is superior because the controls are simply much better. Same with Shaun Palmer snowboarding - far and away agreed that it's the best on the Wii. \r\n\r\nOn the flip side, you can say the 360 and\/or ps3 are for people who aren't good\/serious enough gamers; look at the top selling games, they're all FPSes. Using your logic, the 360\/PS3 is a place where games that can't cut it on the PC go to die.","c0a6tac":"360's proc has 6 hw threads in parallel, which you have to keep busy to really get all the potential out of it. So if you want to get maximum performance, you have to have those cores active all the time. The main problem here is that code has to be paralizable over 6 cores, which still can give a lot of headaches. The advantage over the PS3 is that a dev can re-use shaders from the PC version and simply do all the effects on the GPU. This has limitations however, mainly in the lighting department. \n\nOn the PS3, SPE's are used to use deferred shading, which means that you have more power to do rendering-oriented calculation, like lighting calculations. As SPE's have DMA access to 3.2GHz mainmem over a 3.2Ghz bus, they are practically 'free' (except the time they take to process their datablock). This is the advantage over the 360 architecture where all this has to be done on the GPU as the CPU&lt;-&gt;mem connection is pretty slow compared to the PS3. On the PS3 you can use shaders as well of course on the GPU it has, but as it's a less powerful GPU, it's not sufficient to simply use the shaders from the PC version and be done with it, as that leads to less performance per frame. \n\nSome time ago an interview (video) was posted with Arjan Brussee by a dutch gaming magazine about their deferred shading engine and how they were able to do hundreds of lights in any given scene without much problems. Using that much lights in a GPU shader based engine is not really going to work as current GPU's don't have support for that many lights. You can watch the english video here or read the beef in text:\nhttp:\/\/www.gamezine.co.uk\/news\/game-types\/first-person-shooters\/guerilla-games-spus-secret-ps3-s-performance-$1262922$1264900.htm\n\n(edit) hmm. video doesn't work anymore. Use this one instead, it's a different video, but also should give the same info:\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gJqIhABExzw","c0a6v5q":"Of course a recompile is not going to work, they have to move to different libraries for example for specific tasks to begin with. As the 360 code is already parallellized to make it run on the 6 cores, it shouldn't be that hard to make things runnable on the PS3, however there is of course the point of performance tuning and memory: with the ps3 you have split memory so you have to do different memory management, but if you abstract that away, it shouldn't take years to make it work, though perhaps a year with a small team. \n\nThat might sound like a lot but the net result is that you then have an engine which can run all your games on ps3. That's the point of using an engine instead of a custom clunk of code which is 'the game' like it used to be in the old days. \n\nSure it's also about money. However as L4D sold a lot of copies on 360, why wouldn't they want to have a L4D release on ps3? If they would have done the work for HL2 properly on PS3 (hell, they could re-license the port done by EA and make it better), they already would have had an engine on ps3 for L4D so supporting that game on PS3 would then be perhaps a couple of months tuning. \n\nAgain, that's the point of using middleware. As their engine already has to support multiple architectures, it should already be capable of supporting yet another. yes it's hard work, but that's software.

My playstation3, wii, and atom minibox on my TV all work fine (they're also connected to a battery backup, it keeps my things from turning off when we brown out)    I doubt I'm a special case,  but the evidence is empirical and quite telling.

First of all, if you are able to joke with the whole group, then you have received approval from the whole group. And once unanimous approval has been received, then the coast is clear! \n\nSo lets see. Question 1 about the bitchy fat friend. Well, shes just part of the group and goes along. Went along I should say WENT - see [this](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/8ps3y\/what_is_the_worst_thing_a_friend_has_done_to_fuck\/c0a21tx) for the fallout story.  Really though, I didn't take her as defense, though thats the role that she naturally played.  Makes me wonder now, why the bitchy fat friend category is so ubiquitous.  Perhaps its insecurity that makes them that way?  Perhaps jealousy that the guy is not talking to her, so if they're not talking to her, then they shouldn't be allowed to talk to any of her friends???  \n\nAnd question 2 - no, I don't normally go out to bars alone.  Now I'll go out to the sushi bar or to a restaurant alone.  I travel a lot for work, so I do spend a considerable amount of time in public alone.  But yes, being in a bar alone will, without fail, lead to a guy who will not just leave me the hell alone.  \n\nAnd being alone in a bar with the stuck like glue guy is a tricky situation.  Its hard to be diplomatic, yet firm.  They assume that since you are there alone that you are ripe for the picking.  Why shouldn't it be them?  So you have to get your point across while still being polite, since you do have to walk to your car alone, in the dark in a while.  \n\n\"Yes I appreciate the compliment but I don't date guys that wear plaid shirts with no sleeves!\"  \"Thank you for the compliment but there's a science experiment growing between your front teeth\"  This is usually what I am thinking but never say, lest I get abducted on the walk to my car.  \n\nBTW, I live in the south were plaid shirt wearing toothless wonders abound.  But that really answers the last question.  Because of the stuck like glue guys in the bar, I wont go to a bar alone.  Next time you see a hot girl sitting at the sushi bar reading the paper or something, you probably have a pretty good chance of talking to her if you can find something interesting to say.

Credit cards are for people who can handle money, you can't handle money, you don't get a credit card. Period. If you want to build your credit, give total amount of money to a trusted relative, they pay with your credit card every month until done, that's it. \n\nNo large purchases without at least 1\/2 more cash than the cost of the item (and of course, after bills are paid). This has to do both with ensuring discipline and discouraging impulse buys. \n\nDinners (and other bullshit) are budgeted a month in advance, after the first month you're set. If you have the money to go out 10 times a month then you save that many 'dinners' the month before.

You have to be able to differentiate between correlation and causation here. Improvements in working conditions, abolition of child labor etc. can only happen once increased productivity have made room for it to happen. These things will only exist if people are on the edge of poverty, and once people have been lifted from starvation and poverty these things goes though. Countries today that has child labor does not have it because they don't like their children to play playstation all day, they have it because they would starve or poverty otherwise.\n\nIt's a bit more than a gut feeling, Apart from the anecdotal evidence that quality of living have gone up a lot (kids generally does not have to share clothes with their siblings, things like cheese is much more affordable etc.) There's also the official numbers that says real incomes has gone up. http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Household_income_65_to_05.png\n\nI heard people quote those figures before, but in the context of blaming the fiat dollar as opposed to a gold standard for the supposedly declining real wages.","c0abphj":"Here is why I think the ps3 ends up looking worse usually than 360 on common games, but looks fantastic in exclusives.\n\nFrom a games company perspective, when you make an exclusive ps3 title, you have to make it look fantastic, use the ps3's power to its limit, driving both sales of your title and hopefully console sales as well. You are probably using programmers who are more familiar with maximizing the ps3's capability since they work on it more.\n\nWhen you make a game for both consoles, you don't have to worry about maximizing one console's capability over the other, it just has to work. PS3 owners will get the PS3 version, 360 owners will get the 360 version, and those that own both will choose on their own criterion (best graphics, preferred controller, online, etc.)\n\nIt also makes the most sense to code for the less complicated and more limited system (the 360 by hardware specs) than to code for the more powerful one and have to recode within the other's limitations. So they end up adapting the 360 program to the PS3, and if it works, why spend the extra development time and cost to make it look better when it won't have too much of an overall effect on the final sales numbers. \n\nAddendum: From what people are saying about the texture memory (i don't know about this first hand), it would be much cheaper to use lesser textures than to recode a whole new algorithm to make it look as good on the PS3, whereas exclusive PS3 titles (like Uncharted) have a solid PS3 texture algorithm at their core.\n\nFull disclosure: I own a 360, not a PS3, but have played Uncharted in HD and it is very shiny.","c0absmh":"Wierd because prototype has the opposite going on.

Lastly, I prefer the console because dealing with a wireless controller is nicer than buying a wireless remote for your computer.\n\nEdit 2: Because you bought a $2000 tv you might be thinking you need better cables.

There was a comment earlier by him where he said something along the lines of \"The ps3 costs too much, so sony should lower the price so consumers can buy more games.\"  He keeps trying to force sony to lower the prices with the threat of stop producing games for them, but i don't think this is the right tactic, and frankly, i seriously doubt activision has the balls to do that.\n\nIf activision stops producing games for the ps3, they lose around a third of the videogame market.  Sure, sony would definitely lose customers because of the COD and GH embargo, but there are still plenty of people who don't care much for Activision's games, myself included.  if there was a war between activision and sony, i do believe that sony would win, through sheer corporation size.  Sony might not want to take those losses, but i think the losses from dropping the ps3 price point would be much more than the losses taken by activision's leaving.  If this were to happen, then sony would probably wait activision out and just wait to have them crawling back.\n\nAnd personally, i think that the ps3 is actually gaining some momentum here.\n\nand like a kotaku commenter said:\n\n&gt; I bet EA are absolutely lapping this up!

Thousands of computers world wide join together to one 'super-computer'. The trick is, that unused computing time in home computers or even game consoles gets used as they aren't really used to their capacities nowadays. This project here - folding at home - was brought to life by the Stanford University in California. It uses the computational power of thousands of computers to research the so called 'folding of proteins'. This way, numerous deseases like alzheimers, parkinson or cancer could possibly be cured in the near future. And also scientists in Karlsruhe get supported by worldwide power. (movieclip starts)\r\n\r\nKarlsruhe - the biggest scientific data processing center in Europe. A part of the gigantic amount of data of the 'CERN', the nuclear research center in Geneva, gets processed here. Hundreds of computers work on one single project. Dr. Wolfgang Wenzel of the research departement Karlsruhe tries to go another way: to research and fight deseases, he and his team use distributed computing over the internet. There project peom@home calculates the folding of proteins. Voluntary donors of computional power may participate from there homes.\r\n\r\nDr.Wolfgang Wenzel speaking: \"The poem@home project we brought to live runs for a year and a half now. There are more than 30.000 people in more than 100 countries worldwide who allocate computational power of 10.000 state of the art, meaning 'normal' pcs, every day. If you convert that value, that poem@home gives us with voluntary performance of poeple who provide there unused resources, you may move things, you couldn't do as a single person or even with public research funds.\" [I'm sorry but it didn't make much more sense in german...]\r\n\r\nTo give Dr. Wenzels Team even more computational power, they work to port there projects to the playstaion 3. Sonys graphical'bolide' is, thanks to linux, suited excellently for scientific calculations.\r\n\r\nWenzel: \"The Playstation 3 got the cell processor, the xbox got an own, powerfull graphics processor, both give the output of about 250 pcs within in the amount of money. So if I may calulate my algorithm on that platform, I get 250 more performance for the same amount of money and even those processes maybe distributed worldwide (in\/on\/to??) the grid.\"\r\n\r\nUwe Beckert also uses the processing power of the playstation 3 for a good purpose. He started as a user of distributed computing but today, he develops projects himself in which others may participate with there pc or gaming console. Uwe Beckert works on using computational power of graphics boards for projects. Those should breach known speed records in distributed computing.\r\n\r\nUwe Beckert: \"A graphics board is optimized to do a lot in parallel. Maybe not one step really fast but a lot of them in parallel. And that's how graphics boards today have got the possibility to 'take 256 or more actions in parallel' [I think he wants to say calculate processes in parallel or something] and I am not able to do this on a quadcore processor. So if I am able optimize it for a graphics board and convert it to parallelize it, which is a completely different programming paradigm, the performance will increase factor by 10 or 100.\"\r\n\r\nWith that technology some grid networks will be as fast as or even faster than some super computers. And that's one of the reasons why some people install free grid software to donate ther processing power voluntaryly worldwide.\r\n\r\nUwe Becker: \"On the one hand, there are people saying 'we want to support those projects because they do something against cancer or climate modeling or something like that. And also there's this 'gamer thought' because there's a pointing system where you can join together to teams and compete others.\"\r\n\r\nThose points aren't worth anything and you can't buy anything of them. You only may feel good. Distributed computing still depends on voluntary help from people all over the world.

Also Sony reserved 5-7 mb too so if only really had 25 mb.\r\n\r\nAnd the main reason that it was \"easy\" to make multiplatform games is not so much that they were in anyway the same, but that they used much smaller teams for all these consoles. Also companies would hire other smaller companies to do ports whilst the first was working on the main version, this is usually to expensive and doesn\u2019t work as good now with the size of games.\r\n\r\nNow the Xbox 360 is not just a more awesome PC for 3 main reasons, first it uses the power pc architecture which is what Apples computers used to use. Second is that an xbox has just 512 meg of ram for use by everything, everything can get stuff from it and put stuff in it too, audio, graphics card, OS, network stuff, everything where as a pc has graphics ram, and system ram separately. \r\n\r\nSo anyway they are all very different machines and anyways have been, the closest they ever came to being like a pc was the original Xbox, but they have gone way away from that path now...\r\n\r\nEverything else you said was quite accurate and you do seem to know a lot more about this kind of thing than the average person.\r\n","c0auiu4":"Sweet.

That was 3 weeks and 1 day ago that Sony received it, and I've gotten no word since then. \n\nI also had a launch PS2 that broke in 13 months, and Sony wanted 150 to fix (they lied about the DRE and claimed it was no problem for a few years)\n\nSo yeah... that would be sad, if it actually happened\n\nedit: silly me, replying to the wrong post .","c0avyx1":"I have not done much PS3 programming but i have read quite a bit about the architecture (which i think could be a lot better btw) and yer you are very right when it comes to having to have a very complicated threading system.\r\n\r\nMost of the programming i do is on the Xbox 360 and PC.\r\nThe 360 is by far the easiest to program for, but most of this is due to the tools that have been made for it.\r\n\r\nBut you have to admit that if your making a game for the ps2 (about 25 mb of usable ram and 200-300mhz of arm based power) verses 64mb and 800mhz of P3 power (which is about 2-3 times faster per clock too) its such a leap that the only thing game company's could do is make the game for the lowest common denominator.

You would also get playstation home with ps3 though and a pretty good blu ray player.\n\nThere are a lot of games that you can get on either system so you \nshould make your choice based on the exclusives and features of the system.\n\nSome pros for xbox are: slightly better online, 1vs100 live, fable2, mass effect.\nsome cons: red rings of death, $100 wifi adapter (although you can just use your laptop if you have one or a 30 dollar non-xbox solution)\n\nSome pros for ps3: LittleBigPlanet, God of War 3, MLB 09 the show, inFamous, blu ray player, playstation home, built in wifi.\ncons: more expensive, slightly worse online experience.\n \nBoth systems have some spectacular shooters if you decide to give them a whirl. Gears of war2 is excellent for xbox and killzone 2 is superb for ps3. I would suggest picking up overlord 2 and prototype for the system of your choice. \n\nBoth systems have some killer games coming out as well. I am sure you will be happy with either system. Tales of vesperia is actually being released on xbox so you can take that into consideration as well as mass effect 2. ps3 also has some nice integration with the psp and uncharted 2 won best in show from gamespot for e3 this year.\n\nI would recommend picking up Overlord 2, prototype and Fallout 3 for whichever system you decide to get.\n\n","c0awcfd":"They're both about the same.

Sony has also said they wouldnt be lowering the price at all. Now the way I see it, without call of dutys, guitar heros or movie games the ps3 is dying worse than it already is. How much longer do you think it will take before EA copies Activision and quits too. Then the gap in the libraries is too large to warrent anyone purchasing a ps3 or developing for it.

No doubt, games like Madworld and Red Steel would bomb spectacularly on the 360\/PS3 (in fact, Golden Axe did bomb spectacularly, and the complaints leveled on madworld apply to GA), but because of the controls, the game goes from ok to awesome.\r\n\r\nGames like PES and Fifa all play astound me, because they've changed the way I play the genre. I can't go back to the 360\/ps3 for soccer games - while they may look prettier, the level of control and immersion on those consoles is *shit*, quite frankly.\r\n\r\nSo in a roundabout way, I personally don't think of the Wii as a console because Nintendo took a different tack: instead of competing with the 360\/ps3, they targeted a completely different audience. That hasn't stopped third party devs from shoe-horning all sorts of titles on it, and gaming is better because of it. \r\n\r\nSome wii games are gimmicky with their use of controls, but when they are done well, there's no going back to dual analog.","c0axue7":"Prices for BD media have only just started to come down.

Then when it gets to 2 strikes protect the strike zone just like in a real game using only X to swing without picking a direction or location.  You must draw walks to be successful and taking pitches helps to see any pattern as well.

You were attacking the paper delivering the message instead of the message - the very definition of ad hominem.\r\n\r\n&gt;And as for the \"democratic approach\" you're making a statement about our system of government, that being a representative democracy, you probably mean \"...a Democratic approach\" if you're refering to the political party of that name.\r\n\r\nI am referring to allowing the majority to vote themselves benefits funded by the minority, so my criticism applies to the democratic system as a whole and not to a particular party.\r\n\r\n&gt;Really? Which leaks? Are these leaks something that only O.WSJ are privy to? And you going to accept them at God's truth despite the fact that, well, they aren't facts at all unless they can be verified?\r\n\r\nThey are talking about the initial leaks about the recently published proposal to raise taxes on the \"rich\" to pay for the healthcare reform. I'd say that the currently published legislative proposal has proven those leaks to be true.\r\n\r\n&gt;And beyond that little problem they're linking these made-up tax increases with \"government health care\" \r\n\r\nThat is based precisely on their estimates on how much additional costs will be needed to cover the expanded helathcare system. The rest of the deficit will be dealt with separately (and just a guess - with more tax increases ).\r\n\r\n&gt;You might want to point out that the '50s through the late '70s were the most prosperous years in US historyt and somehow this came to be with these terrible taxes?\r\n\r\nPlease, help me understand - is your position that the higher the taxes are the better the country does? If not, what is your opinion about the relationship between taxes and the overall prosperity?\r\n\r\n&gt;I'm tired, maybe I'm just missing it, but can you tell me how they came up with these figures?

I have Dead Space and Fallout3 for PS3 and the graphics difference seemed a lot less to me than the reports, so little in fact I never really said \"Eww that's ugly\" while playing, I just enjoyed the games.  Then you have the slew of sports games which have strong communities on both and look good on both (NHL, FIFA, Madden, etc).  And finally, CoD on the PS3 has a good community in 4 and 5 and they look and play well on it.  Maybe not better than the 360 but, not enough different in any way to be noticed unless you have a stick up your butt and want to find things.  \n\nHonestly, there are a ton of games out there.  You can't buy into the argument of no games on the ps3 since 90% of all games are on both and the exclusives offered on the console are really, really good.  You have to really look and it looks as if the choices you are looking at (RE5 - which plays the same on both from my playing of it, GB, Skate, Lego Indiana Jones) aren't really the ones most people would look into to be honest - minus RE5.

Of ocurse nVidia and ATI will show off their most powerful and expensive cards, but they make the most money selling affordable products which is what they do. Its business as fucking usual for them, what has changed however is that PC games have declined in quality because publishers have given up investing in their development, thereofre now you need really poewrful computers to run games like Assassins Creed and GTA4.\r\n\r\n&gt;The graphical leaps between every generation of games keeps getting smaller, so people don't want to upgrade for such small gains\r\n\r\nI guess in your apparent stupidity you don't realize that new consoles are also released?\r\n\r\n&gt;Pretty simple to understand, one would think.\r\n\r\nApparently not because douchebags lke you are still pirating games.\r\n\r\nPC gaming is declining, however you want to paint it, you can say 'gee wizz well it's not dead soyou're wrong', no, wrong answer you stupid imbecile.

If the target is far away, then the bullets trajectory will arc down, and will also take time to traverse the terrain. That means if the target is moving you'll have to aim \"3 heads higher\" and 3-4 bodies ahead\" to score a hit. You'll slowly be able to understand distance and arc, while taking notice of the bullets impact and streak. It's very hard to notice these subtle elements since the character jumps into the reloading animation as soon as you fire. But, believe me , they are there, and very vital for your understanding of accuracy.\n\n\n\nSecond, the reason the opposing team has capped a flag 30 seconds into the opening of the game is because pilots are using the planes as quick transport to key flags. My main strategy on Iwo-Jima is to press x [ps3] rapidly as soon as the map loads to be the first guy to spawn, then run as hell towards a plane [ps, you always spawn, with your back facing the  planes], get in, and fly straight to the opposite end of mount suribachi. Parachute right on top of the flag, cap it, then run straight to the air raid station. In less than 60 seconds, your team will have a key flag, and an air raid assault. Btw, if you are a sniper the lighthouse is a death sentence. Please avoid.\n\n\n\nIn guadalcanal the sunken ship is Sniper's heaven. You can swim and up the wreck climb it and shoot from the second level. With such a good view of at least 3 flags, you'll be able to rack up quite a number of kills. My record is 5 kills from the ship, I know redditors out there can probably double that amount.\n\n\n\nThe best way to learn how to fly is the tutorial. With no enemies on your back and flac fire from the ground you'll have wake island all by yourself. The announcer will give you the most important tip for flying, if you want to make quick turns, release the gas, you' slow down a bit, but i'll look like your turning on a dime. After the tutorial, and at least 4 to 5 matches of air superiority you'll be an Ace. Once you are  an Ace, you should change to first person perspective and fly from the cockpit's point of view. The first person's perspective will give a better feel of altitude, which is vital for bomb runs with enemies manning flac cannons. The lower you fly, the less expose to flac fire you'll be.","c0bf3no":"If IGN is to be believed they're re-mastering it and releasing it later this year, remastered for the PS3.

Those six cpu threads share three VMX128 altivec processors for all heavy math, and that assumes you've gone and done the Data-Parallel work that makes the PS3 such a bitch to work with.  The SPE's virtually require data parallel approaches, and are basically slightly more intelligent standalone altivec units, except there are eight of them (7 in the ps3).  The ps3+graphics card has the same bandwidth to its graphics and main memory as the 360 has to its l2 cache, which it too shares with the video card.\n\n**DO NOT** argue that the 360 is more powerful.  Its not, not in any comprehensible or imaginable way. The 360 is a reliable every day car with a big V8 fresh from the factory; fun and powerful.  The PS3 is a Ferrari, one that has to live in a factory garage by the race track, and one that the has broken more game developers souls and crushed more companies hopes than can be comprehended.\n\nIBM built some matrix multiplication apps for the sole purpose of showing that the PS3 could indeed hit 200 GFLOPS (single precision), which it did.  Thats 85% more than what the XBOX's theoretical maximum is.  Please, **stop** arguing against facts.  Theres incredible ground to argue on that the 360 can make better games, but the \"meme\" that the PS3 is more powerful is based off the realities of the hardware and facts.","c0bml6y":"i was reading the ps3 forums about this, aparently theres a widely distributed hack going around, but the PS3 tech team are on the chase planning to punish those hacking.","c0bmldo":"inb4 ps3 sux all teh dix!!!!!!!!1111!!1111!!","c0bmmwr":"The 360 has superior gpu compared to ps3 and the extra cache on the gpu means \"free\" 2x antialiasing(aa). Ps3 is not more powerful. You could argue whether cell is more powerful than 360's cpu, but the cpu is hardly relevant for most games, and even though cell does help in some graphical departments, ultimatelly you cant really say that ps3 is superior. Check gta4 for example. Ps3 has a blurovision filter because it runs on lower resolution and doesnt have the 2x aa that the 360 version has. But the ps3 has better explosions and less popup(probably because of hard disk caching).\n\n360's hardware, if you ignore rrod, is obviously better designed and better suited for a gaming console. It is a purpose built gaming console. Much more balanced and more cost efficient.\n\nAlso the bluray isnt that much advantage for most games. Bluray only gives you storage. That doesnt mean much about the quality of the graphics, etc. There are other bottlenecks. Yes, you could use uncompressed textures but does it make any sense? For example i could use .wav for storing my music, but why using .wav when .flac is clearly superior(takes less space without ANY deterioration of sound quality).\n\nAnd btw the 360 with 60gB is actually cheaper than wii atm in my country(240euros vs 250euros). And the 360 arcade, without a hard disk, is even cheaper(180euros). So wii isnt in a class of its own when it comes to price. And yes, wii tapped into the casual gamers market but both ps3 and 360 make huge efforts to appeal into the market. Just because something is appealing to the hardcore market, doesnt mean that it cant have games\/controllers for the casual gamers.\n\nAnd Sony is the second worse company after Apple when it comes to fascism. Sony made a decision. Kill ps3 market share in order to promote bluray. They delayed ps3 and gave it an almost obsolete gpu(by the time ps3 came out) because they wanted to have bluray on the console. \n\nThey priced ps3 really expensive because it costs a lot to make and because they dont want it to compete with standalone bluray players. They made it hard to program because they wanted to use the cell cpu, which even though is good for multimedia, it is \"special\" when it comes to gaming. And then tried to mask this \"speciality\" as an advantage. ","c0bmneg":"Yup.

Do you think we all have some kind of huge fences surrounding our prison-like houses? Do you think we speed out of our garages straight onto the highway?

But whatever you mean, it's obvious that it's *incredibly* subjective, so here's my subjective experience: I have been a part of many different types of communities in America--some that consist of immediate neighbors, some that consist of people who work together and live nearby, some that consist of people with common interests, but who almost never see each other at all. I've been a part of nurturing communities of like-minded progressive people, and stifling communities of back-stabbing jackasses. I guess what I'm trying to say is: we've got the whole gamut of communities her... just like everywhere else. \n\n&gt;You drive everywhere, \n\nOkay, this is mostly true; certainly for the 40% of people who don't live in major urban areas, and even for a lot who do (most US cities have pretty pathetic mass transit)\n\n&gt;isolated in your little bubble of existence, with no human contact,\n\nWhat the Fuck?

It still falls down to the cross-pads of older Sega and Nintendo controllers.  The analog stick placement is nothing short of moronic (it's needs to be *right under* the d-pad?), and the sticks themselves are clearly based on the N64's analog stick -- they're loose and convex.\n\nThe L2 and R2 shoulders buttons are a giant step backward.  It tries to be both an analog trigger *and* a shoulder button, but instead isn't a decent version of either.\n\nThe less said about Six-Axis, the better.\n\nBut let us not forget that in order to charge the controller, with its [embarrassing battery life](http:\/\/www.videogamesblogger.com\/2008\/02\/02\/wii-xbox-360-ps3-controller-battery-life-tested.htm), you have to keep your console turned on.

Not many of my friends like the ps3 though.  We know its a more powerful console, but we don't like the controller...Anyway I don't think that study is accurate.  Most of the gamers I know are of normal shape to in somewhat good shape.  Most of the gamers I know play mostly fps on live, Wii, and the occasional rpg.  Maybe my friends and I aren't the gamers the article is talking about, but I smoke up and play live almost daily.  Side note (Maybe thats a pot issue...haha)  I agree that we all have heard the stories of the stereotypical fat gamer nerd who just plays games their entire life.  That was in the past.  Now, pretty much everyone I meet is a gamer.  We have parties all the time, drinking , smoking, playing wii, or having the guys over, drinking playing cod or halo, and talking trash.  Its fun.  My past two gf's play video games, and they are regular good looking girls who drink beer, watch the sox, and play video games.  Lots of people are gamers now, its just a matter of how much time you play and what constitutes a game.  This article tries to tie hardcore gamers to an unhealthy lifestyle.  The wii has changed that, and actually helps you burn calories.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the article attempts to link video gaming with anti-social behavior.  I believe the opposite.  Rockband is one of the most sociable things to do nowadays.  It brings people together.  Xbox live halo and cod sessions with your buds, while sipping and smoking bud?  Come on, that brings people together.  When you go on a killing frenzy on halo 3, in front of your friends, thats just mojo...\r\n\r\nAnyway, the point is this article fails to define what they claim is a gamer, and what gamer behaviors are healthy\/unhealthy.  MSNBC is a nice liberal tv station, but sometimes subjects not covered much on this network seem to get only generic or sterotypic coverage\/judgement.  I personally only know a few fat gamers, but thats just my area in maine.  I'd say MSNBC has not done their research on what they consider a \"gamer.\"  The article seems to blanket the entire game subject as unhealthy, but does playing Wii Yoga and Wii Fit constitute as \"games,\" even though they help burn calories?  MSNBC also fails to research the millions of people who socialize and play Live, Rockband or Wii.  Games are evolving and MSNBC doesn't recognize it.\r\n\r\nReading this article makes me think of the average gamer sterotype, but thats just not who we are anymore...","c0c6gzd":"thats some good news.

That is to say, the game play experience is one that is probably the most enjoyable. Blizzard has also made a very decent effort to keep their storyline in check and keep the \"world\" of warcraft enriched with minimal continuity errors (I'm still amazed by how Blizzard got deathknights to not work for the Lich king, but for the horde\/alliance). So WoW also has a very decent cast of characters and most concepts are not just pulled out of some marketing intern's ass without refinement. Most of what I've said so far is representative of many Blizzard's works. This is also why they have many fan boys.\n\nLearning curve isn't too steep, but it is somewhat difficult to master. This is highly challenged by the fact that gameplay analysis about WoW in great detail is highly available. Still, it's a game where the good players are seperated from the pack for a reason, both in pve (vs computer) and in pvp (vs player).\n\nIn terms of \"timesink\" WoW really gives the most entertainment per hour compared to those before it like EverQuest and FF11. Some people call it \"too easy\". I like how I can actually get things done (make a satisfying amount of progress) in 30 minutes ~ 1 hour. My FF11 friend thinks that makes the game too easy.\n\nIn game trade is also relatively \"balanced\", as being rich doesn't automatically make your character and gameplay experience superior. The best items (and many essential ones) have to be all acquired through a nominal amount of gameplay. Need a mount to get around quicker? You have to reach the appropriate level (and for many players they will earn the gold needed by then). Want better gear? You'll probably get it while you quest around and level up along. There's really no need to go out of your way and \"grind\" (although some quests are a little too tedious).\n\nThe \"hardcore\" gameplay starts at level 60\/70\/80\/85 (next ex.pack). Essentially, you can play as you see fit until you hit max level and almost never feel you're inadequate, weak, or a total noob for the most part. However, learning the apprpriate tricks and strats while questing or running dungeons\/instances do make your life easier, and are mandatory when running those 40\/10\/25 man endgame dungeons. Basically, you can play anyway you want while you level, but do note that the levelling experience has been designed to guide you to the \"correct\" path for future pvp\/raiding.\n\nSo what's everyone doing being \"addicted\" to WoW once they reach the max level? Basically, killing the hardest boss (available) in the game. Gearing up the characters so they are \"near perfect\". Once that's done, players focus on other characters (to do the whole thing again), different gearsets\/playstyles, or pvp (killing other players). Pvp is almost another game from pve (against bosses\/computer) entirely, as you're pitching your characters against each other. And yes, they have a pvp gearset too, just so players can't use the best gear they got from bosses, then claim to be the best pvp-person (this is under debate). Do note that Blizzard releases update content (new dungeons and bosses) periodically, in addition to gameplay tweaks in between expansion packs.\n\nLast but not least, WoW has a very nice customizable UI. Googe WoW UIs and check them out, you can play the game with so many different interfaces it's not funny (People write them). They streamline gameplay experience and really just make life easy while you play. Think about having to do your job with notepad vs. Emacs\/Vim\/notepad++, or wordpad vs. Word 2k7\/XP, or lotus 123 vs excel 2k7\/xp, or... you get my drift.\n\nThe only real problem with WoW is \n\n1) it's a game, not everyone likes games, and not all games. \n\n2) It's a huge mega time sink. Instead of all that WoW, you could be finishing the entire pc\/xbpx360\/ps3 gaming catalogue or leveling your Srpg- characters to lvl 999, or finishing off a library full of books, develop other hobbies, or god forbid, spending more time with your significant other, and family (heh), or running 15 miles a day, or buffing up so you can look beefier than Arnold and post a youtube saying \"I'll be back\". Most people like to use sex, family, exercise as prime examples of what else you can do besides WoW.\n\n4) It's online. Other people are online, some of these people you will hate, and will hate you. Sometimes, they're the only people around and you'll have to play with them. The single player component in WoW, while great, still hits a limit. Eventually you'll need 9 or 24 other people to work with (used to be 39).\n\n3) 15 bucks a month + internet after initial purchase.","c0cau09":"Let me see (nice astroturfing btw)\n\n###Redditors - not sure whether to upvote this article as a prime example of shill, or at least criminally dumb, writing. Representing Apple as proDRM when they fought tooth and nail against labels who realised they were getting too much control, because Apple saw the benefits. Deliberately trying to play off 'google don't be evil' and pushing Microsoft in there... WHY????\n\n1. Microsoft is artificially inflating the prices of net-books\n1. Microsoft is artificially limiting the specs of net-books\n1. Uptake of computing and 'net access (niaively - ignore youtube commnts increases freedom and education in countries- educated and free countries (niaively - ignore the US's murder record) are more peaceful.\n1. Microsoft finally triggered human thinking to realise that software bugs need a legal definition (see all my comments the last two years on reddit - how trillions have been wasted on worms that WERE NOT ILLEGAL (calling legal, open functions in outlook)) see recent reddit articles on the issue\n1. Microsoft had a DRMd mp3 service. It shut down and **everyone lost all their music, you know, the worst case doomsday scenario of DRM, it happened with Microsoft**\n1. Microsoft astroturf the fuck out of the web, and you let them. All this hype over bing, the releasing of 'surface' to try and quash consumer knowledge of the iPhone (lol) and now this bollocks over zune hd... which.. completely astroturfed - its a fucking 2005 device, not even out, and can I just say, zune died a long time ago, don't believe me, **read pennyarcade**. Don't trust that shit, ffs - and to all the legitimate wanker bloggers putting in keywords (remember Microsoft played a game of sending fake referrer keyword data to blogs with search terms from their own search engine to increase awareness of their search engine amongst bloggers??)\n1. Microsoft seeded billions of fake search referrer data to blogs to try and get bloggers to talk about their new search engine\n1. Apple have an appstore that has a 'quality controlled' ecosystem - YES, I am pissed off that Apple is tie to carriers - but unlike the most cocksucking bloggers, I knew from the first instance they would have to appease a network to succeed, and I hope, like they did with itunes, their goal is to subvert the evil telcos later on.\n1. Apple pushed and improved online sales of MP3s, and finally gave credit to remove DRM - paving the way of removing DRM forever\n1. Microsoft still push DRM, use it as a way of KEEPING CONTENT ON WINDOWS, removing user choice (see deals they strike)\n1. Microsoft, using anti-competitive practices force computer stores to limit sales to just windows computers, and also just intel as some points (intel do this too) REMOVING CUSTOMER CHOICE\n1. Apple took a stagnant, 20 year old industry and redefined it with the iPhone - changing so many people's lives and GOT ME LAID.\n1. Microsoft caused the BluRay - HDDVD war because they objected to the presence of Java on BluRay - this has cost millions of people hundreds of millions, as well as retails, hurt the future promise of HD, or delayed it, which keep prices inflated for us\n1. Microsoft went into the games console market, and I FUCKING TOLD YOU  (and that time, slashdot) NOT THE FUCKING BUY THAT SHIT. But like ignorant fucking twats, you go out and buy it. Microsoft rush out an xbox 2 with so much fail, but cover it with a vast influx of the term ['fanboy'](http:\/\/www.google.com\/trends?q=ps3,fanboy,xbox360) but finally the fake xbox260 forums were outed and the ps3 won - not before GTA4 was seriously limited by the xbox2's capacity (because Microsoft donotwant BluRay because of Java)\n1. Apple don't allow flash, Java or scriptable stuff on iPhones - while mostly this is to protect the ecosystem, and profits, it is under determination by AT&amp;Twats - if they make a more open model, if security wise it was feasible, there would be no financial incentive to do this I AM A FAN OF THE ANDROID and iPhones being limited pisses me off but nowhere near how happy they make me that Nokia can fucking die now.

Take my PC as a prime example: it's a treading behemoth (three feet long, a foot wide and three feet tall) - she ain't pretty, but she don't fail me on hardware. Ever. Period. Can't say the same thing about software stability though (damn developers.)","c0ceydk":"I would love for this to be true, mostly so Sony would have an incentive to get software based ps2 emulation working.","c0cezvy":"From what I understand, the slim is using a 45nm processor as opposed to the 65nm processor of the original ps3. That should mean it creates less heat and is more power efficient. I don't know if the case ventilation itself is better or worse, but I imagine even if it was somewhat worse, the chip itself is still going to be running cooler than the original ps3.","c0cf0o5":"just back up the old ps3 hard drive and install it on the new one","c0cfhab":"You are wrong.\n\nBetween retail and downloadable games you have plenty to choose. Don't make me do a list...\n\nBetter yet, let's check Metacritic: from the [~110 games](http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/games\/ps3\/scores\/) with good (80+) scores, ~30 are exclusive titles. That's more than a dozen \"ma friend\".\n\nIt's still a subjective matter but it's way more accurate than your definition of good. ","c0cfkhx":"because you could play *copies* of playstation 2 games instead of real ones. Plus, even if you played real ones, you'd probably want to copy ps3 games (if you could get your hands on a bluray burner)","c0cfp5d":"It's pretty clear that you don't like apple, and no one is forcing you to - but you're using that as license to rant on with patently incorrect information. I like writing about this stuff because I'm fascinated just how wrong people get the facts, and simply refuse to actually acknowledge what actually goes on out there.\n\n\nI'll be brief, to address the points you made in this point-counterpoint manner\n\n&gt;At least they had a choice to not use Windows. They didn't even have the option to run Apple's OS and when a compnay did offer a fully legit, licensed version of Apple's OS on their own hardware they were quickly sued out of business.\n\nI assume you're talking about the Pystar case(or rambling, not entirely sure there), the computers they make require a hacked-up version of OS X, this is not a legitimate operation and reselling this kind of derivative works is copyright infringement in the USA. If you're talking about the clones of the early 90s, the licensing agreements finished and were not renewed, nothing special occurred back then.\n\n&gt;Are you ignoring how the iPhone works when you posted this? On Windows any 3rd party developer can create a program and sell it to you without any approval process from MS. Try that with the iPhone. Having the OS maker decide what the consumer can install and the developer can create for its platform is far more anti-competitive then mangling a few API's.\n\nPoint 2. It would only be anticompetitive if you couldn't buy any other phone. MS, Palm, Nokia all have app stores too and all had the ability to run apps before the iPhone even happened. Apple have provided and documented the APIs for their platform, they have also set out the rules in which to engage the platform, and have been remarkably clear in what they'll distribute through their application network. This is not the same as Windows, with MS deliberately denying competitors access to APIs &amp; file format documentation, and definitely not the same as changing APIs to deliberately break competitors software. The iphone &amp; Mac OS platform actually give overwhelming access to create and interact with all the media files. In fact iTunes creates a file called iTunes library.xml, iTunes itself doesn't use this file. This file is specifically so other applications can easily read and use the itunes library. Palm is an excellent example of a company who are deliberately trying to make a fuss - they have all the tools they need to make a piece of syncing software that will use the itunes library, but instead they'd rather impersonate ipod devices(a breach of the USB t&amp;cs) to try and get syncing inside iTunes.\n&gt;I am curious how IIS would know IE is being used and where you got this tidbit from? I am genuinely curious. I would also argue Netscape played a pivotal roll in its own demise. The software got very crappy very fast all IE did was provide a better more user friendly alternative to a bloated dieing piece of crap.\n\nPoint 3. IIS &amp; IE worked together using non-standard transfer methods, for this reason IIS was able to transmit pages quicker to IE, at the same time a standards compliant browser was left waiting. Do a google it was well published.(why on earth you wouldn't before actually writing a reply is lame). Also IE was based on the Mosaic browser, and if you do a little bit of history reading, you'll see that Mosaic -was- Netscape, so it's hard to describe it as superior in any sense - the programs were virtually identical, they worked in a very similar way and shared code. I.E. your argument here (as above) is utter unresearched bullshit.\n\n&gt;The vendors could have ignored DirectX, MS didn't force them to use DirectX nor did it block OpenGL from running on its platform.\n\nPoint 4. DirectX is a perfect example of a monopoly at work - if Microsoft don't support a method out of the box, then hardware makers won't make hardware to support it, as there is a limited audience. That is how businesses work - you don't make products if there is no market. The only reason OpenGL has vendor support is due to it's cross platform nature. The exact situation happened with USB on windows - many motherboard manufacturers did not include USB because windows would not support it, likewise HUD makers didn't use USB because no computers had it. The exact same thing happened with S3, EFI, ieee 1394, the list goes on. This is how a monopoly stifles innovation.\n\n&gt;The tameness of the action doesn't make it right. It is still anti-competitive and it is still wrong.\n\nPoint 5. If you make an app, which goes against the terms and conditions and it gets rejected, is it really the vendors fault? Meanwhile the reasons were actually pretty clearly laid out in the FCC response (take that reply from apple however you will - but it's probably the most official word you'll get on the matter.)\nYou probably need to stop thinking about the iPhone as your home computer and start thinking about it in the same way that you would treat your nintendo, xbox or ps2, which all use the same software model. (Heck even zune uses this model now - so much for your pro-microsoft argument.)","c0cfpkc":"They better do justice for the ps3 version this time.

","c0cgg8h":"I have to say, unequivocally, that I have an emphatic hatred for the prequels.  However, there are parts of Revenge of the Sith I loved, and I truly feel that the story was pretty layered and nuanced and would've been brilliant in the hands of another director.  \n\nIt was the unchecked hubris of George Lucas that allowed for the insipid decisions that ruined an otherwise interesting story-arc.  As with everything, it's not what you say...it's how you say it. . .and unfortunately no matter how intriguing the source material was, if the execution doesn't work....the entire package doesn't work.  \n\nAnd this was truly the case in the prequel trilogy.  Stunted, inane dialogue, characters we couldn't relate to or sympathize with (save for, perhaps, Obi-Wan), CGI that somehow looked less impressive than the FMV of playstation 2 games and had absolutely no sense of weight, depth, or dimension to them, boring, plodding exposition that revealed little of significance and ultimately infuriated the fanboys (the force is actually created by microscopic midichlorians in our blood?), and iconic scenes that many fans of Star Wars have envisioned for decades squandered ruthlessly or handled unbelievably poorly (the extermination of the Jedi, for instance).  \n\nAnd I didn't even MENTION how weird it was for Padme to end up with Anakin when she called him \"Annie\" when he was an 8 year old child and she was a teen, or how I didn't buy Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader AT ALL for so many reasons I won't even bother listing them, or how weak and sterile the Jedi seemed to be when they were supposedly at their height of power.  I could go on, but I'm getting angry just thinking about everything I came to detest about these films.  \n\nSuffice it to say, the prequels were tremendous failures that had incredible potential and could've been something truly extraordinary if it weren't for the massive ego of a deluded self-important narcissist.\n\nThat said, I will always adore the OT, even with all the mediocre elements of Return of the Jedi.  The vision of those films resounds loud and clear even 30 years later, and they're imbued with a passion, an energy, and an imagination that few movies dare aspire to.","c0cggw3":"whoa there -- you don't have to do this at all :-) you can download PS3 media server onto your computer -- and as long as your computer with said media is in the network, you can transcode and stream all media content to your ps3 in real time.

Strange.","c0cgnkc":"I've always thought that the easiest way to explain it was by relating it to software.\n\nImagine that you have a PC.  But you are told it is actually a PS3 and that it looks like one.  So to complete the illusion you download a PS3 emulator and play roms on it.\n\nBut the roms play terribly because ps3 emulation is really shitty.  You get crashing, bugs, and for most roms the thing wont even start.  You then find out that it really only half works for one game.\n\nThe only real solution is to give up on trying to make it a PS3 and just let it be a PC.  Maybe download a game or two from steam.  Play some dungeon crawl or Wesnoth.\n\nI hope that clears things up.\n\n","c0cgozy":"From the comments:\n\n&gt; @BigWoopMagazine, its not that they are playing favorites but they are programming for the least powerful of the two systems which means we get kind of screwed in the graphics department\u2026..can you imagine if they programmed it for the ps3 they sent it to the 360, it would look so bad, the should program wii and 360 games together and program for the ps3 seperate, but with the eventual spike in ps3 sales from xbots getting ps3\u2019s they will hopefully start doing better for our system.\n\nHeh, the [PS3 was the lead development platform on this game](http:\/\/multiplayerblog.mtv.com\/2008\/05\/02\/ghostbusters-developer-prefers-working-on-ps3-first\/).

I think it makes sense they would release a new Starfox mainly because they focus so much more on entertainment value on the WII as opposed to the ps3 and 360 where the focus seems to be more on graphics.","c0cgyzw":"my girlfriend loves katamari.  that is the only playstation 2 game i can ever remember playing with her.  oh, and rock band.","c0ch4km":"The game was entertaining mainly because of the graphics, there weren't any other game that looked like that, especially on consoles. And your comment about hte ps3 and 360 is also not correct.

Great games.\n\nOther games I have enjoyed:\n\nAssassins Creed\nDrakes Fortune\nInfamous\nDynasty Warriors\nGT5 Prologue (I would wait for GT5 proper though)\nLittle Big Planet was OK\nThe Penny Arcade games.  On The Rain Soaked Precipice of Darkness 1 and 2.  (Three should be coming out soon with 4 to follow.)\n\nI would avoid the videos\/movies on there.  They are VERY expensive and you can not move them to anything else.  eg.  You spend $19.95 to \"own\" a HD version of \"Great New Movie\".  You can not copy if from your PS3 to your PC to watch it and If you delete it, you have to buy it again.  Better hope the HDD doesn't die.  (Games you can redownload)\n\nI would also do as others suggested.  Buy a larger drive online.  Newegg has great prices on WD 320GB 7200RPM 2.5\" laptop drives.  If you are really into wasting $, you could also get a Solid State Drive.  \n\nI also recommend PS3 Media Server + AVISynth if your media storage computer is Windows and MediaTomb if it is running Linux.\n\nI bought a [charging station](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/PlayStation-3-Charge-Base-2\/dp\/B000X2H8UA\/ref=acc_glance_vg_ai_861_1_tit) that makes it very convienient to charge the controllers.  Just drop them in place.  No plugs to worry about.\n\nIf you intend to play games that require a lot of typing (PS Home, chat, etc.) or you plan on installing Linux on it, I would also recommend a Bluetooth Keyboard.  Logitech makes one for the PS3 that includes a little trackpad, but I am sure others work well.\n\nThe PS3 uses Bluetooth for everything, including the BR\/DVD remote control.  The [PS3 Tooth Fairy](http:\/\/www.ps3toothfairy.com\/) is an excellent tool that allows a universal remote to control the PS3 instead.","c0ch7fv":"they probably want to encourage hacking ps3 to the point where it's possible to run copied games on it from the harddrive, which will skyrocket the sales of the console.","c0ch98k":"ps3 slim doesn't run linux I'll buy a xbox 360.","c0cha84":"sorry it affects game selection and game development not really a factor in gameplay.

If they could offer it for $299, they would.  But BC was the first thing they dropped to keep costs under control for a reason.  They had to weigh the two options.\n\nAs manufacturing continues to improve, perhaps when they officially retire the ps2, BC will return.

Dependent on your dismantling skills you have two (well, three) options.  \n\n* Remove the drive assembly, take it apart, clean the lens using a Q-Tip and lighter fluid (Ronsonol or Zippo, NOT charcoal fluid though).  \n\nTutorials here: [Open it up and remove the drive assembly](http:\/\/www.llamma.com\/PS3\/repair\/PS3_disassembly_tutorial.htm), [Open the assembly to expose the lens](http:\/\/progamer.cc\/blog\/ps3-laser-kem-400a\/how-to-replace-a-ps3-bluray-lens-guide.html\/).  \n\nThen soak the Q-Tip in the fluid and gently wipe the lens. Put it back together. Done.  \n\n* No disassembly required. Find a long Q-Tip, soak the end in fluid and (using the pics in the second tutorial to estimate the location of the lens) gently insert the Q-Tip into the disc slot (assuming it fits) and try to wipe the lens clean.  \n\n* The \"sort of\" option, Dust Off through the disc slot. \n\nAnother possible cause is that the lens is improperly pitched (or burned out). There is an adjustment mechanism you can use (or simple replacement, tutorial 2). This requires full dismantle and trial and error tuning, which is more tedious. If cleaning fails, I can give you some tips if you want to try this.  \n\nJust a note: the reason for using Zippo fluid is that it is a gentle solvent that contains naphthelene which is composed primarily of long chain hydrocarbons (safer). It also evaporates quickly and leaves no residue. In contrast, using something like rubbing alcohol (isopropyl), is harsh, could haze the lens and evaporates relatively slowly.  \n\nEdits: Formatting, Grammar, Clarity","c0cjpk7":"Nope not there.

According to [this](http:\/\/businessmirror.com.ph\/component\/content\/article\/52-technology\/15147-sony-cuts-price-of-ps-3-introduces-slimmer-model.html), Sony has sold 24 million PS3s worldwide.  At the time of that article, all of those PS3s were of course the \"fat\" model.  According to [this](http:\/\/www.examiner.com\/x-6894-SF-Console-Game-Examiner~y2009m8d23-Analyst-says-Sony-is-losing-100-per-Playstation-3-sold), Sony loses roughly $100 per console sold.\n\nThat means that at 10-20% of non-gaming purchases, Sony lost an estimated $290mil - $580mil.  \n\nNow, this crappy math requires several things.  Namely, that the numbers and sources are accurate.  For example, [this](http:\/\/www.techdirt.com\/articles\/20061116\/085020.shtml) article from before the PS3's launch states that they lost between $240 and $310 per console, which would of course double that figure above.  Another google search result said $50 per console, which would of course halve the figure above.\n\nSony makes money off of accessories and games.

You are still (and will always be) a human being and you are as normal as everyone else. No need to put these problems before yourself. \n\nAccept them! Don't ignore them, but be careful that you don't define yourself by these problems.\n\n**Edit:** To clarify: a stupid example: Image you have flu...\n\n (Take flu as a metaphor for your problems. I don't want to say you these are not big problems for you nor that they are not important, Oh noe, I feel with you: Beeing depressive is not funny) \n\n...if you say to yourself: \"I am the flu-guy\/gal\" You make this stuff part of your self-esteem (If you like or not) Try to think of it more this way: \"I'm a nice guy\/gal and I have _currently_ the flu, therefore my brain hurts a little but things are going to get better soon. \"\n\n_You are not crazy. You are OK._\n\nFeeling alone is a shitty feeling, but If you would be brave and go out and try to meet other poeple you will realize that everyone feels alone from time to time (a lot of poeple feel that that way very often if not always). \n\n_You are not alone beeing alone :)_ \n\nAnd: Your brain is not fucked up! It just thinks that way because of certain chemicals or certain psychological things make you believe your brain is fucked up. Its actually not. You are browsing reddit and asking questions - this a is definitly not fucked up. So calm down, relax, take a deep breath. Love yourself! Accept your problems. _Don't use them as an excuse. _\n\nIts hard and it hurts but if you feel lonely _go outside_! Join a club, go in the park, exercise - I would rather not attend too much parties (That don't means you should miss them, just well - only 3 a week maybe :) they are often a bad place for getting _really_ in touch with poeple. Better do some activites: sports, chess, linux-user-group, learning a new language, whatever... you know what I mean!\n\nI'm quite fucked-up for myself too (well another story) but the only thing I can tell you for sure: Don't be afraid _really_: Don't be afraid of poeple! If you are surrounded by idiots whose only mock you: Fuck them and look for some real friends. \n\nCollege is good place to find cool poeple easily - They are there! There will be lots of morons, too but also a fair share of good, great poeple. If you are feeling really wrong: Take - as others pointed out -  a break - its better to take a break earlier than later (look at me - I skipped it for various reasons and things just got worse)\n\nSo: Don't be afraid of doing whatever your gut says in all honesty to you. Sometimes you are simply in the wrong place for the wrong reasons or for the right reasons in the wrong place so make yourself clear what you want, not what others want from you.  \n\nWhat works for me in regard to feeling-better is beeing at least a little bit organised and able to understand the lectures and beeing good at it. This will give you a feeling of security and if you are a good student you'll earn easier respect from others. Well - But from my experience a depression is also the best way to not be a good student... So avoid falling into that trap and make some basic organising and learning and understandig a habit, its critical for survival - And I can guerantee you in almost every discipline is stuff that is somehow \"awesome\" if you only digg deep enough. \n\nIf you're first thought is something along the lines of \"I will never understood that shite\" but you put some effort into it anyway and finally have enough understanding you will be start to become addicted to learn new stuff and things will be much smoother and you'll have this heuraka feeling! I struggle with exactly this point and I'm sure its the reasons for a lot of headaches. So be wiser and get your shit sorted out.

Sometimes I take this music stuff too seriously - but then again, someone has to.  Music is one of the last pure artforms, it should be an expression of something\/someone.

I guess its just a polarizing game\n\nIt's a cult favorite among hardcore gaming enthusiasts, probably almost as popular as Devil May Cry 2 at this point, and it's really well known for getting slammed by reviewers despite what most people that purchased it thought. It's graphics are lame and it's purposefully over the top but its actually one of the deepest beat-em-ups ever made and doesn't take itself too seriously. It has a lot of mechanics and huge variety of enemies and difficulty settings that make it appealing to the kind of people that you probably think are asshats for being able to do infinites in MvC2 or reliably waveshine in Super Smash Brothers: Melee or something like BXR in halo.\n\nI think one reason that people end up hating game reviews is that they only play it for a day or two (sometimes often not beating the game, but not actually saying that unless the game was so terrible they never want to beat the game) and from that vantage point its basically impossible to determine the depth of the game. \n\nThe thing is you can't really blame IGN: the hardcore audience is likely a small portion of the readers but a significant portion of the vocal individuals that discuss the game, and the way that hardcore gamers would enjoy games is so independent of what a game reviewer could possible determine in a day means that game reviews are totally worthless. Even what I think of it the first day isn't even that great an indication of the amount of time I will enjoy it. I really don't enjoy games that don't have a direction of obvious skill and nearly limitless room for improvement of that skill that goes beyond mashing faster or simple reaction time, which is the vast majority of AAA titles. I don't necessarily think that is limited to multiplayer games (God Hand is an example that indicates otherwise) but its probably greatly limited to multiplayer since almost no singleplayer games provide realistic\/noticeable avenues for skill improvement; it typically emerges from the hardcore community over time after the game is released. No amount of time playing the Warcraft 3 campaign on expert would get you anywhere near to the level that people play on the worst ladder now.","c0cms36":"yeah, i have to remember that not everyone has the ps2.

Bigger countries like the US and UK will suffer a bit more because of the nature of their economies and the fact some of their financial institutions collapsed.\r\n\r\nHeck, if you recall originally the stimulus was meant to keep us out of recession - it failed at that. Of course what Rudd and co don't want anyone to know is the reason the recession wasn't so bad here is because our banks are heavily regulated, they have always been heavily regulated, even before Rudd, and it kept them from freefalling and while it kept Australia from becoming a power house economy it certainly kept us living within our means and as such well protected against instability. We kept our financial institutions from doing stupid things and as such when times got rough they faired better than foreign companies.\r\n\r\nYou're actually taking MASSIVE leaps in logic to argue that because Rudd put us in the biggest debt in our countries history we didn't get hurt too much by the recession. Can you actually quanitfy how Rudds waste in money actually helped the economy such that it gave us enough benefits to justify the hundreds of billions of dollars our country of 20 million will have to pay off? As far as I see a lot of economists around the world who commented on australia commended us for our stringent handling of our banks - i.e. our rational behaviour during th egood times, which contributed to our relative stability in turbulent times.\r\n\r\nI mean look at it this way: The countries which suffered most from the recession were already in heavy debt, what did Rudd do? He moved us from a strong position where we can fight econimic instability and put us in an extremely vulnrable position. Without a doubt we will suffer from a recession (however minor) in the next twenty years, and when it happens it will be several folds worse because we are in massive debts already.\r\n\r\nLet's not even start talking abou thte aftermath of this 'stimulus', I mean don't get me wrong, I wholeheartedly support spending money on infrastructure, what I don't support is putting us into debt to mail $900 to random gits - I don't even support putting us intno debt for infrastructure but now some shmuck is buying a TV or a ps3 cos Rudd has deemed it necessary for th eeconomy. Of course when you buy something expensive only a fraction of the purchase goes towards the Australian economy as most of it ends up overseas, hoever if you invest in australian infrastructure then the vast majority of the money stays in and benefits australia most.\r\n\r\nIf Rudd was 'level headed', he would have created a program focusing on Australias long term, by investing in infrastructure (it is best to do so during recessions anyway), by doing so he would not only create many jobs but he would also give the country major assetts it could use in the future. Heck, look at the US, to this day they benefit from investments during the great depression made by their government, however if their government had put money into $900 cheques I very much dobt anyone today would be getting any benefit from that.","c0cq4k5":"360 seems too low, ps3 too high, wii about right\n\nthen again, i would like some detailed info on the stats rather than them just throwing them around","c0cq789":"Alright, thank you..

It uses less bandwidth on my network. It looks better(up-scaling).

Very reminiscent of Shadow of the Colossus bosses. \n\n* Best animations of any game I've ever seen. The characters have an incredible sense of mass. You do a dive-roll in heavy armor and your character just bangs onto the floor like a 100lb bag of rocks.\n\n* The fighting system feels very real. You don't just run in and swing your weapon like a madman like in God of War, and enemies don't just ding you for a couple HP each time. You have a stamina meter that drains 25 to 50% each swing or block (though refills in a few seconds when you are not taking any action), and getting hit drains at least as much health. What it does is create a very deliberate, tense battle system, where every action really counts. You will circle your enemies, wait for an opening or a good block, then heave your sword in to provide a powerful blow. \n\n* Similar to the above, you are on equal footing with most enemies in the game. It takes 2 or 3 hits to kill them, and it takes them 2 or 3 hits to kill you. Some enemies have healing items too to further even the field. \n\n* The gear looks freaking awesome, and swinging the [meat cleaver](http:\/\/i134.photobucket.com\/albums\/q111\/scape13\/P1040462.jpg) for the first time was one of the most satisfying things I've ever done in a videogame.\n\n* The atmosphere is excellent. They've really captured the claustraphobia of old castles, church staircases, mineshafts, decrepit jails... there are old, creaky, mechanical elevators, medieval style traps, and some incredibly intense dragons \n\n* It practically demands multiple playthroughs, both from new and old characters. The 3 basic character types (warrior, mage, rogue) all play very differently, wear completely different gear, and have all their own sets of stuff. Plus, New Game+ (and ++ and +++, ad infinutum) offers escalating difficulty (so the game never gets easy) and lots of gear you couldn't get on your first playthrough. \n\n* No quick-time events :)\n\n\n\nHere's the thing about this game: I read about it when it originally came out and about the English version and I wasn't impressed.

While on earth and with secular matters there is certainly a difference, spiritually one sin is no different than a million.  Each leads to death.  \n\n&gt;everyone is on equal moral footing?\n\nWe are all sinners and therefore destined to death, but Christ has given us freedom from our sins.  If we repent, we are made clean - not by our own actions or ability but by God's grace.  This is the key difference between Christianity and every other religion, including Judaism and Islam.  Almost all religions are about works, do this don't do that, but Christianity is at its crux (no pun intended) about the Grace of God.  \n\n&gt;But then you have no case against Christians who go out of their way to condemn homosexuality as evil.\n\nI would say that it's no different than any law of the Bible.  But let's say for argument's sake it's a sin.  The Christians that believe that should do one simple thing: not fuck other guys in the ass.  Pretty simple, really.  An extension of that is the church: if a certain church sees Homosexuality as a sin, they should forbid that sort of thing from going on *inside the church* for its members.  Simple as that.  Meddling in government affairs is not what should be done.  Give unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and unto God what is God's.  \n\n&gt;It still makes sense to go out of our way to condemn certain sins more than others: say, crimes against humanity over gambling or premarital sex.\n\nOh, I agree - as a secular society.  But spiritually a mass murderer is no different than someone who committed idolatry by focusing on the worldly things more than focusing on God.  So a guy who plays playstation more than God is  - spiritually - in as much danger as the mass murderer.  But secularly we must punish the mass murderer, either by execution or life in prison or what have you.  These are two separate things.\n\n&gt;And apparently some Christians see homosexuality as an especially serious sin\n\nYeah, they're human and they're - in my opinion - wrong.  If homosexuality is a sin it is no worse than my own.  Secularly I have absolutely *no* problem with it.  There are many Christians (and many non-Christians who criticize them) who confuse *culture* with *religion*.  Aquinas, theological badass though he was, was still a human, prone to make mistakes.  And I'm not saying he's wrong that homosexuality is a sin - he's a wiser man than I will ever be.  But I am saying he's wrong that there are differences - spiritually - in sin.  I'm even a Catholic - the whole mortal\/venial sin is pretty sketchy to me...all sins are eternally damnable.\n\n&gt;So I don't think your point about equality will yield the practical dividends you want.\n\nIf a single Christian hears what I have to say and understands that devoting more energy against homosexuality than it - as a possible sin - deserves, than I've done something about it, and that's great.  Or if an Atheist discovers that not all Christians are blind when it comes to the difference between religion and culture...that's good too.","c0d05z4":"Too late.

Smart playlists are the obvious one, but also categorizing music so i can press 1 button and shuffle my entire collection, without holiday music. And i never, ever have to update a single playlist file. \n\nAnd with computers, I've basically stopped building them myself.

My dad used to tell me that I should always have 2 year of \"bread\" in savings before I spent for anything else.\n\nAnyway my advices are:\n\n* Save money\n* Start looking\n\n**Saving**\n\nYou still have 6 months in your worst case scenario. It's short so I'll recommend the crash route. Cut on all the shit that is non-essential and be brutally honest about what is. 3g on your phone is not, cable tv is not neither are starbuck coffee, going out to a movie, gym subscription, eating out even if it's only at macdonalds, vacation, your girlfriend's birthday, ps3 games, that bar of soap that cost $3.5 instead of the pack of 3 that cost $1.5. Driving to work. New clothes, even socks can be mended, kellog's food, that white box of corn flakes with no name taste the same once you get used to it. :|\n\nGet rid of all the subscriptions that you can get rid of. Get rid of your credit card debts if any. Your objective should be to cut your monthly expenses down to 1\/3 of your salary after tax the rest should go in your saving account. Drop your flat or share it if you have to. If it a nice flat sublet it to someone while you crash at mom and dad's for a couple of month.\n\nIf you're american, get all the medicals test and diagnostics your current coverage will pay for. Teeth, full check-up, whatever you can. Get anything that needs to be fixed done now. If you're under long term treatment for anything deal with your doc to increase the qty on your prescription so you can stock whatever it is you need (provided it can be stored).\n\nIf you can do that in 6 months you should have enough savings to get by for another 6 months. I know you're thinking \"That should be a year\" but job seeking cost money and you'll have unexpected stuff to pay along the line.\n\n\n**Looking**\n\nAd-crawling is the worst way to find a job. It's tedious and not very efficient. Start networking. Make good with managers, co-workers, everyone. Some of them might leave and think of you when an opportunity arise somewhere else. Then go through all your company's clients starting with the one you personally worked with. Friendster them, facebook them, linked'in them, whatever. Make sure they like you. Don't tell them you're looking for a job right now. Feel the water first, figure out which of them are going down, which are surviving and which are making money.\n\nUnfortunately you can't go all out and tell them you're looking for a job because you would most likely be in breach of contract and could be fired on the spot which wouldn't help but if they see you as a reliable person some of them might later go as far as to create a position for you when you'll be available.\n\nOk, so it's planned for the worst where you get fired in 6 months. It may not be what happen but at least you'll have a chance to be ready and if you don't you'll have some extra cash in stock for future crisis.\n","c0d4tva":"...\n\nI swear you must be trolling...\n\nAll of those things do require drivers.

A language is a set of rules for how an abstract machine behaves, with no mention of how one might implement that machine.  This is not a trivial objection, because every mainstream language has several, if not dozens, of vastly different implementations.\n\nJava's a good example.

In the latter case, the bytecode itself can be interpreted, compiled ahead of time, or compiled on demand.  Or you can compile [C to Java](http:\/\/www.xwt.org\/mips2java\/) **source** code, or to [JVM via MIPS machine code](http:\/\/nestedvm.ibex.org\/).\n\nEven when you run a \"native\" binary on x86, your CPU is translating it through one or more intermediate representations and eventually to individual unit-control signals.

Voluntary charity does not nearly cover it.\n\n&gt;You could, hypothetically, have parents purchase an insurance policy that will last children until they're, say, 20 years old\n\nIf they're disabled and the parents are poor? Do you know how fucking expensive that would be? Besides, it wouldn't BE insurance, the child would need ongoing treatment for an existing malady, not treatment for potential maladies. The free market would quite rightly price it highly. Care is expensive.\n\n&gt;In the event that fails, voluntary charities can apply to any sort of natural disparity. You say yourself that you would have no problem having the government take the money from you to give to these disadvantaged groups - so there is no problem you have giving that money anyway, yes?\n\nSo if, for instance, 6 out of 10 people refused to give money to these disadvantaged groups you'd expect me to make up the difference? What if like them I didn't give anything?\n\nAre you prepared to let them die? It would come to that.\n\n&gt;Why would you assume it would be different for anybody else? Charitable contributions increase voluminously when an individual's income increases, after that individual has surpassed a certain level of education (a.k.a., has learned not to be miserly to the point when it doesn't even benefit oneself).\n\nIn America that is because it is a massive tax dodge.\n\n&gt;I want to correct SilentRadical's notion below that there is a possibility for a 'communist anarchism.' Only when the means of production are so vastly efficient that the effort to produce a good is negligible will this be possible; until then, people's self interest will continue to trump empathetic interest, as it has in the past - otherwise, seizure of another's goods is necessarily a coercive act, and is incompatible with the idea of anarchism.\n\nPerhaps the disabled child has less of a right to life than you do to your cappuccinos and playstation 3s.\n\nOr perhaps a coercive act isn't necessarily a bad thing.","c0dcxfd":"&gt;It takes more than 10 minutes if you don't do this sort of thing all the time. Physical time to unbox the thing, make sure you've got the right cables, figure out why it's not connecting to your wireless network, do the updates, setup an account, etc...\n\nWell it takes a lot more than 10 minutes to play a playstation. Maybe 16 hours to complete a single game? And if you're technically adept enough to understand the controller, plugging it in etc should be a snap.\n\n&gt;Who said I don't have the time? I might just care to use it somewhere else. Don't make the mistake of assuming you understand my motivations.\n\nI'm not questioning your motivations. I'm thinking about how anyone could fall for this and not be a sucker, and drawing a total blank. Because its a lousy deal even if you are rich and your time is valuable.\n\nI have a friend who earns something like 600,000 a year in rental properties. His time is far too valuable to waste on video games, and when his kids are older, I suspect he'll trust them to set it up without buying anything too expensive (though they would have to work hard at it to spend more than 130, plus he's rich and \"money isn't an issue\").\n\nBut here's the point- he would just get one of his assistants to do it, and he pays those guys like 12 bucks an hour to run his errands. Anyone rich enough that they outsource their chores to others is astute enough to know that 130 dollars is NOT a good price for a single menial chore, particularly when they have to come over for a one-off job.

These were the games I spent most of my time on, and got close the end (if I hadn't beat it) on all of them. I had multiple saves of each game, allowing for restarts, and different pathways and character sets (Star Ocean and Tactics here). I had an RPG Maker game pretty big, It took up about 4 or 5 slots (including the scenario data as well as the layout data.) This is a lot of data and alot of slots to be saving on memory cards. I did not want 10 different memory cards and have to remember which game of which save file is on which card. I had one of those 360 slot memory cards, the ones that have the two buttons and have a combination of numbers and letters. Some games were on A1 while multiplayer games like Baulder's Gate and Jedi Power Battles were on B1. One day I got to play my RPG as usual...Data not found. \"Ugh! must be on the wrong setting.

'course, if your phone just bricks on you, T-Mobile will replace it.  People have done just that when screwing up the DangerSPL install.  (DangerSPL aka Haykuro SPL.  It requires more knowledge than the HardSPL because it's \/not\/ compatible with all phones and requires a different Radio image be installed *first*.  People try to just flash it directly and brick themselves.)\n\n&gt; If you root your phone do you lose apps on the system storage?\n\nThe rooting process I linked you to requires that you reflash the SPL, and your ROM.  Unfortunately these processes *do* cause you to have a factory-reset \/wipe.  HOWEVER -- you \/can\/ simply dump your \/system\/app and \/system\/app-private folders into a folder on your computer via `adb pull` beforehand (doesn't even require root, IIRC) -- and use `adb install` afterwards to reinstall the apps once you've rooted.  It's a pain, but... nowhere near as much as re-downloading everything via the Market.\n\nAlso, any apps you've purchased are tied to your credit-card.  So long as you keep the same credit-card for the phone, you will always be able to re-download purchased apps any number of times you please.\n\n&gt; Are any apps negatively affected?\n\nRight now, the Experimental CyanogenMod is running with the Donut update.  The SDK for that just came out about a week ago... so not *every* app is compatible just yet.  (It's 99% compatability, but everybody has that \"just this one\") -- Luckily, however, Cyanogen keeps a \"Stable\" ROM as well.  \n\n&gt; Also, what if you store an app on the sd card then you swap sd cards, is that case handled fine?\n\nIt's generally not recommended to do that -- the Apps2SD functions being used out there will also set your Dalvik-Cache to the SD card.  The phone'll boot if you put a new card in there -- the core-system apps aren't transferred to SD on the Cyanogen, JAC, nor JesusFreke ROMs -- but it'll have to rebuild the Dalvik-Cache for things to work properly.  \n\nObviously, if you decide to place a swap partition on your SD card and try to pull it, that'll do nasty things to your current session of the phone.  \n\ntl;dr here -- worst case scenario, you'll have to reboot.\n\n&gt; What about contacts, do you rely on syncing with google in order to restore contacts after getting root?\n\nPretty much.  That's fairly robust, though.  As long as it's not a \"phone-only\" contact, it doesn't get lost.  If you're worried about it, \/and\/ your privacy, you can store your contacts on the SIM card (I forget how to do it) and then pull them from it again afterwards.\n\n&gt; I use connectbot but sometimes I want to go hogwild with unix screens and multiple servers and I just need a bigger screen. Tetherbot tunnel works just fine in those situations.\n\nFair enough.  In that case you might actually find rooting your phone \/more\/ appealing.  Via dropbear you can have *native* SSH on your G1 -- which means you can run it via ADB rather than relying on Tetherbot.  ( http:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/showthread.php?t=442754 )\n\nSince you mentioned having difficulties with the proxying, this would seem to be a somewhat more robust solution.\n\nAnd I'll also go ahead and give a shout-out to the fact that you can \/also\/ get true bash rather than ash terminal on a rooted phone -- complete with bash_profile support and LSCOLORS if you go the Cyanogen Experimental route.\n\nAlso, if security matters to you, having the ability to make VPN connections via the G1 is also A Good Thing. :)","c0djv81":"&gt; I'm pretty sure the Beatles will be irrelevant within 100 years, yes. \n\nI can't forecast for 2100, but they've managed to remain relevant for over 40 years; longer than any other band. \n\n&gt; They're mostly selling re-issues these days, to old fans.\n\nYes, that's why Beatles Rock Band sells so well.

But there are two little-known facts right now that indicate Nintendo did well to choose 480p: \n\nfirst, HD adoption rates are still very very low. we havent' reached 50% yet, and the HD adoption rate for consoles is far lower, probably due to the kids getting the old tv for the game console while the new hdtv stays in the living room for tv and movies.\n\nSo all those PS3 and Xbox360 fanboys out there, most of them are playing on a screen that displays LESS than 480p. that is fucking insane! There's no point in having HD output with awesome effects if you are still playing on an old CRT screen with ~350 scan lines.\n\nOn top of that, while the PS360 output 720p, the games are not rendering in 720p. they are rendering in something significantly less, typically 540 or less, and upscaling. so even the \"HD\" consoles are not actually HD consoles. No point in jacking up the output on the wii if the competition isn't really that much better.\n\nNow, you may ask, why do the wii games look so much worse? overall, the answer is that the ps360 games are being developed to look really really good, regardless of outputs. wii games generally speaking are designed with cartoonish stylings and focus on gameplay rather than pretty pictures.\n\nOn hd displays specifically, wii games look worse simply because they are outputting 480p, which looks chunky on an hd display at the pixel level. this is most noticeable on diagonal lines, where there is zero anti-aliasing. You could step up the power a bit on the wii simply to upscale and apply some anti-aliasing, and things would look a bit better.\n\nOr you could simply develop beautiful games and not worry about it. Zelda:TP had its moments, although the aliasing is pretty bad on HD display. There were some great looking GC games toward the end of its life that look good in HD. we simply need a better attention to visuals by developers, in more wii games, and we really don't need more horsepower to do that.","c0dk2l4":"I have a playstation 4. it took that long to update it.","c0dk47n":"Halo 3 ODST came out for 360\n\n[Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xbcMI0FjlBg) looks interesting for the ps3\n\nbut most my gaming time goes into madden and sf4","c0dk4rw":"[raiden 4](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=snOsCBFMy_c) just came out for xbox 360.  there is also [raiden fighters](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RbuDJ33gdBw) which collects the first 3 raiden games.\nfor ps2 there is [silpheed](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SulrsxWY66E), [castle shikigami 2](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=reR_0EAfKLo), [r-type final](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XbH_VfLeB48), and [gradius 5](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=i-bViNdLDu8).  \n\nThe PS2 games are all under $10 used.

I'll try to keep to the basics.\n\n1) Rooting your phone allows you to alter\/modify the core guts of the device.  This allows moving your applications to the SD card.\n\n2) Cyanogen's Apps2SD script will also relocate your Dalvik-Cache to the sd card, thus decreasing the storage load on your NAND flash (which ironically extends its life; but it also makes the read times faster due to there being less data to read through, on your \/system partition.)\n\n3) Cyanogen enables CompCache by default, which is a RAM-based swap feature.  This extends the RAM of the phone, allowing you to run more applications simultaneously, or not have to reload things when being run.\n\n4) Similarly, any rooted G1 can use swap memory, either as a partition or as a swap-file on your SD card.  This is something that a \"stock\" G1 simply *cannot do*.  Freeing up real RAM for active memory usage speeds up the phone while under heavy load.\n\n5) Themeing is also an option.  Cyanogen in particular makes it quite easy to theme -- but you needn't use \/only\/ his for that.\n\n6) Cyanogen has ported most if not \/all\/ of the Donut features to his ROM.  This is part of where Google is picking a bone with him.  This includes things like VPN support, Global Search, and a slew of other items.\n\n7) .odex optimization.  Some say this doesn't do much, but... the .dex\/.odex files are also used during boot-up, for rebuilding catalogs and the like.  Optimized .odex files mean quicker boot times.  Again, this simply \/\/cannot be done\/\/ without root-level access.\n\n8) While Cyanogen hasn't touched it, people are playing around with how the phones reserve RAM at boot time, trying to eke out more \/actual\/ RAM for the devices.  \n\n9) Being able to alter the \"guts\" of the phone means you can do little things like replace the core ash terminal with the bash terminal.  Or add native a SSHd.  \n\n10) Underclocking and overclocking of the CPU.  Cyanogen's ROM has CPU scaling built into the kernel.  This can be enabled by default, or you can use apps like SetCPU to get fancier (SetCPU has power-profiles that can be used to do things like set to maximum CPU while on power, underclock when the battery reaches below a certain point or when the phone is asleep, etc.  These are obvious battery-extending features.)\n\n11) The list goes on. And on.","c0dl7ce":"They have to make a financial decision. spend x dollars to port to wii, and get y return in sales. if they think x is greater than y, then they won't port.\n\nI think a lot of their calculations are wrong, though. the Wii platform has insane market penetration. ps360 developers are under the illusion that teenage boys don't own Wiis. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nOh there is one other factor in play here: most game developers are lazy.\n\nThey see the horsepower of ps360. They see the hard drive. They start to drool all over it because now they don't have to work as hard to get their games to run well, look good, and load fast off the dvd.

The existing customer base for the PSP aren't likely to pay US$250 (AUD$450) for a unit that they already have (plays the same games, does the same things etc). The PSPgo's will likely end up in the hands of people who don't already have a PSP. This is the new market I'm talking about and Sony is trying to reach. New users.\n\nIn regards to New owners wanting to purchase existing games at market prices, the games available on the playstation store right now range anywhere between $15 to $29. Are these prices as good as what some craigslister can offer me, probably not. But they are fair. If you're a budget gamer, why buy a PSPgo when the older models can do it all for a lower price? \"because I wanted a PSPgo and I WANT old games\" I hear someone replying, but look, short of telling you to suck it up and just dealing with what you have, i'll do you one better and say, You don't want a PSPgo, you like the hardware but it wasn't made for you, it was made for those guys with disposable incomes who want toys but aren't fussed about UMD's and conversions and all that doohickey. If you're really that enthusiastic about the PSP, you defintiely need to get a PSP-1000 or 2000 model, because you can run those UMD's you want at below market prices (bargai bins) and you can run your homebrew and emulators. IT's just a better fit for you. \n\nYou probably recognize one of the main issues I'm seeing as well, that some of us in the gaming community are unhappy that the PSPgo just doesn't cater for the old users as well as the new ones, and that's the point really, Sony wasn't trying to make a unit that pleases us. We KNOW we can get umd's cheap, but **they** don't, and they don't care. they're happy to purchase their shiny new overpriced bit of hardware and to download their games. But I'm cool with that, because I'm already happy with my original PSP phat.  \n\nNow with what you were saying about the lackluster media capabilities of the PSP, this threw me off, because 10% of my time is spent playing games on my PSP, the other 80% is used for watching videos. \n\nI catch the train and tram to work everyday, so in that 1.5 hour period i can get quite a few eps of tv shows in. Right now, i have Arrested Development, Sons of Anarchy and Spaced on my mem stick. They look and play beautifully on the PSP's huge screen. But ok, you said you didn't like it comapared to other portable media players. But whats the difference, with the Zune, Ipod touch\/iphone, you still have to do the conversion process for the media files you want to play right? So why are you singling out the PSP? I honestly don't understand why'd you describe it as \"crap\" when its no different to the ipod touch or zune HD, if anything the experience is better with the larger screen. keep in mind, the PSP doesn't use some obscure video format, it uses the same format as ipods, mp4.\n\nI also addressed some things in another [post](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gaming\/comments\/9oc2r\/metal_gear_solid_peacewalker_demo_now_available\/c0dmcki) which I feel is somewhat relevant here in this discussion.\n\n&gt;Also, is your PSP running custom firmware? If it isn't, then updating the official firmware shouldn't be an issue to you since no homebrew runs on it anyway.\n\n&gt;If you're running custom firmware then you'd know this simple and quick fix I provided just saved you time from doing your own research, you also don't have to get rid of your custom firmware setup just to play a demo, and, it works.\n\n&gt;So is Sony making it difficult for people to use the PSP? No. It's people like me who make it difficult for myself because I like to keep running older firmware while running newer games. This does not reflect Sony's attitude at all, just my own and other PSP homebrew enthusiasts.\n\nAlso you ask if I'm ready to upgrade and if i'm willing to lose my homebrew functionality, and i'll tell you right now, ANYONE who is running CFW will not want to upgrade their PSP. I didn't even consider it and I'll tell you why. My PSP does everything I need it to do and more. What I need it to do is play video files and a couple of games.

I had to watch my cousins, who are 6 and 8 year old girls.  I brought out the old collectors edition disney VHSes of the classic 2D cartoon movies.  Dumbo, Pinnochio, Alice in Wonderland -- I have all of them.  Before the credits even ended at the beginning they were asking questions like \"Where's the pixar lamp?\" and \"Is your TV broken because the screen is fuzzy\" and \"What was that box you put in that DVD player?\"  and the nail in the coffin, \"Ew, this is one of those drawn movies.  yuck can we watch wall-e?\"  The restraint I showed in not beating them should be grounds for canonizing me after I die.\n\nI remember when the internet was pay-per-minute on a 4800 baud modem and your two options were AOL or CompuServe, and you usually couldn't connect because the lines were full.  When you did get online, your household shared the SAME login and the SAME email -- extra email accounts cost an arm + leg + first born child + kidney.  You had dozens of search engines to choose from that were equally useless with such gems as infoseek, hotbot, lycos, altavista, dogpile, excite, webcrawler.  Back when you couldn't play multiplayer games on the internet without directly connecting via isdn or modem lines to another person's modem.  You could also get 3-4 demos on a floppy disk which usually had the first few levels of a game on it without being sugarcoated, letting you legitimately try before you buy.  Apogee and 3drealms, I loved you as a child.  WTB Wacky Wheels again.  Then when CDs became mainstream you could get 10-20 of those fuckers and have your virtual pick of the litter.  Hell, even playstation had them for a while, and these demo discs were free!  And if you were lucky enough to have more than one computer and wanted to use the internet on both at the same time, you used a magical device called a \"hub\" to connect the internet to both computers at once.\n\nCell phones were the size of remote controls, color screens and text messaging weren't around.  And for phone calls in general, you didn't have to dial the area code first, unless you were calling long distance.  Yes, that's right, phone numbers for your friends were 7 NUMBERS LONG!  Oh, and long distance phone calls were calls outside of your own area code, and boy were they expensive.\n\nTVs were fuzzy, but nobody noticed or cared because there wasn't anything to compare it against besides movie screens. Big screen TVs were 4:3 and weighed a ton while taking up a lot of space.  You had a remote control for each device individually -- if you were lucky enough to have a TV that came with one!  They used to jack the price up a good 200 bucks for a tv that had remote controls.  If you didn't have one, your dad called you from the other room or your friend's house and made you change it.  Forget about cable TV boxes, only rich people had that.  We all had basic cable, and we liked it.  Sure there were only about 44 channels, and maybe about half of the families I knew growing up were stealing cable (because it was easy to do), but it was worth it and people would visit just to watch.  Oh, and the one kid out of your circle of friends with a TV in his room was the man.\n\nIf you wanted to do anything with a friend on a weekend, your parents would call their parents and set things up with them.  If you misbehaved, you got a spanking -- none of this time-out passive aggressive punishment shit.  You'd ask for toys for christmas, flip out if you got clothes or dumb board games like Parcheesi, but generally understood that throwing a tantrum because you didn't get everything you wanted would result in a santa-style eggnog beating.  And it always was that 100 dollar pirate ship lego set that you didn't get.  Fuck.  Then the next day you went with your family to wait in line behind every other fucking family in the world at the only department store within 200 miles to get your annual family photo taken.  Seriously, you always seemed to be at the back of the line, even when you were next.  That one family behind you kept you sane, though.  Why weren't there any people ever behind that one family?\n\nPeople called \"winter break\" its more realistic name, Christmas Vacation.  You wore a starter jacket and laughed at anybody that owned an apex-brand knockoff.  Oh, and your jacket HAD to be a pull-over parka style one.  Zippers were totally uncool.  The hierarchy went Starter Parka &gt; Apex Parka &gt; Starter zip-up &gt; Apex zip-up &gt; kmart brand.  You went hog wild about pogs and magic cards until they got banned from school after some kid stole another kid's collection.  You still snuck some in to school inside your trapper keeper though, alongside green day's \"Dookie\" album, which you didn't really listen to all the way, you just liked to laugh with your friends about how \"cool\" the cover art was.  All you ever listened to was Basket Case because it was popular, longview because they cursed and the hidden track because you thought you were special because you knew about it and also knew it was about beating off.  Oh, you might have heard welcome to paradise at least once, by accident, because you forgot the name of longview but heard them use the word \"paradise\" in it -- even though you OWNED THE FUCKING CD.\n\nBaseball Cards (TOPPS), Hockey Cards and Basketball Cards were AWESOME.  Garbage Pail Kids ring a bell?\n\nYour school had no computers, just one TV with a VCR on a cart that they moved from room to room.  Your grade would get to watch one video in the fall and one in the spring.  It was always the sandlot.  Your teacher would fast-forward past the three parts where they swear, but they would always start the fast-forwarding too early and fast forward too long, so there was about 6 minutes of the movie you never got to see.\n\nBig League Chew.\n\nKids watched the same cartoons no matter what the age, and Nickelodeon programming was worth a damn (it hasn't been watchable since 1998, go look at the number of quality shows that died in 97\/98).  You always wanted to go see the slime geyser in orlando.  You always wanted to get on Guts or Double Dare or win their sweepstakes, but you had NO FUCKING CLUE what the FUCK a self addressed postcard was.  You'd yell at how bad the kid diving down the slide on Double Dare couldn't find the BRIGHT RED flag in the pile of syrup and whipped cream.  You'd yell even harder at the people climbing the aggro crag because you knew you were faster.  You knew that the temple on Legends of the Hidden Temple was easy, and the people that would lose deserved to be ridiculed.\n\nMr. Wizard and You Can't Do that on Television were on before school, and you got up at 5 every morning just to watch them.  And you never said the phrase \"I don't know,\" you snaked around it to avoid the slime.\n\n\"DID I DO THAAAAAAAAAAAT?\" was a meme of the time.  So was \"NOT THE MAMA!\"  Family Matters, Home Improvement, Full House, Seinfeld, The Simpsons and other now-famous shows were NEW and EXCITING.  Sitcoms were so much better back then, and you watched them all, except Step by Step and Blossom.  Ok, you watched Blossom too.\n\nYou made a time capsule at one point and buried it in your yard so you could remember all the stuff you had at that time sometime in the future.  But you forgot about it and probably can't remember if you ever had one now.  It's probably filled with mood rings, your favorite cassette tape that you recorded straight from your radio, pictures of you and your friends with snap bracelets and good old super soaker 50's, except that one asshole with a ss 100 or 200 because his parents threw him gifts instead of love and attention.\n\n\nI could keep going but I fear this is probably gonna get downvoted due to my wall of text, that and the fact that I just started listing old shit that was awesome but will never be the same, instead of actually listing how some kid has made me feel that way.  But I figure everyone here is smart enough to see that it's all so changed now when you just THINK of the late 80's\/early to mid 90s stuff.  Ah I had fun remembering.","c0e3f4t":"Have you seen the ps3? USB controllers, charge with any USB port. Standard laptop HDD. Standard bluetooth headset support.","c0e3ffv":"Sorry, I meant BestBuy.

My avatar was a walking radio station back then. So anyhow, through the experience of actually dev'ing blue-tooth warez to work with ps3, I never encountered any talk of compatibility problems, but maybe I didn't notice. I would guess the headset was not in paring mode, so double check that first.","c0e5e0n":"I named the black guy in FF7 \"Big Negro.\"  My neighbor (who happened to be black) broke into my apartment and stole my playstation.

I have a 360 and almost never play it.  All the good games on it are also on PC (similar dev platform), and they look better and you have a MOUSE on the PC.  \nThe PS3 is good, imo, for the different stuff.  My favorite games are little big planet and uncharted.  Motorstorm: Pacific Rift is also very fun.  \nAll the systems have games coming out I'm looking forward to though; crackdown 2 on the 360, and gow3 and mag on the ps3.  At the moment I'm absorbed with Aion, so have no time for other games.  \n\nIf $300 isn't too big of a deal for you right now, I'd say get a ps3.","c0e5r7l":"isnt that a playstation one gennisis game?","c0e5s11":"yeah Metacritic is good for scores...but sometimes it's more about the text than the score\n\nNow THAT's a Metascore: http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/games\/platforms\/ps3\/uncharted2amongthieves","c0e5ujm":"You'll soon be able to \"download\" a \"heavy rain\" http:\/\/ps3.ign.com\/objects\/811\/811232.html#","c0e5vsx":"They also are re-releasing a few ps2 games in 720p for $20 a pop. ","c0e63d2":"I've both a PS3 (60gb fat with ps2 compatibility) and a 360 (elite). Before that I had a ps2 for years. \n\nOnline experience: If you want to play with friends online and need cross-game chat, ok, live is better. If you don't play games online a lot, like me, it's hardly any 'better' than PSN. That said, PSN has a solid on-line service as well, so it's not as if you're missing something when opting for a PS3.\n\nControllers: it's personal preference. I like the PS3 controller more, but I think it's because I am used to it from the ps2. The 360 controller is much more clunkier than the ps3 controller and its digipad really sucks compared to the ps3 controller. its triggers are better, though IMHO not really that noteworthy.\n\nGame lib: I really want to like the 360 but recently I discovered that I actually havent liked that much games on 360 as I have on the PS3. Again, personal preference I guess. Games like Halo3... I really don't see the fuss, it's an average FPS with sub-par gfx. GeOW1 was great, GeOW2 was really silly IMHO and often simply boring. Mass effect was very enjoyable, and so was Shadow Complex, the rest... not so much. \n\nOn the PS3 I've enjoyed a lot more games, but again, it's likely personal preference. \n\nWhat's coming this fall and early 2010, I can honestly not think of a reason to buy a 360 if you don't already have one: the games are either the same titles with new graphics (f3) or rehashes of a boring game (h3 odst), or multi-platform games. PS3 has IMHO a stronger lineup this fall and early 2010. \n\nBut again, personal preferences might make one think the complete opposite. FWIW: one should look at what's already released on a console and if those games appeal to you and then buy that console. No 'online cross game chat' (or lack thereof) can make a sucky game great.","c0e63s1":"slim plays only ps3 and ps1 games. Not sure if you want ps1 games on a 42\" plasma tho ;)","c0e64uj":"If you have a friend with an xbox 360 (and an xbox Live Gold account, with some friends who play), just try it.  You'll see what i'm talking about.  As soon as you turn on your console you can instantly see every game that your friends are playing, or whatever else they might be doing (like watching a netflix movie).  You can jump into their party and do your own thing while they play, but you still have the ability to talk to them.  You can jump directly into their game if you want, etc.  You can even watch the same movie together or share photos etc., all sync'ed up and chatting the entire time.\n\nYou can do one or two of these things on ps3, but the ps3 is very me-too design for online features... all tacked on, and not thought out the way xbox live is.  But like another user was saying here, if you don't care about friends\/online, ps3 is a great system.  But if you DO care about playing with your friends, to say the ps3 has even remotely similar features in terms of USABILITY and EASE is simply lying, or they don't know what they are talking about.","c0e655x":"The fact that xbox has had this since launch (for 1 on 1 chat) and over a year for party chat exemplifies the unfriendliness of the ps3 for communal gaming.  Sony simply did not think about an actual online community the way MS with xbox live did...  So now they are trying... with in-game XMB they added earlier, HOME finally launching, etc., but it's all a mess compared to xbox live.  They will never catch up until the next generation is out.","c0e6d7x":"I say YES, way too easy.  That was until I finally played Demon's Souls on my PS3 last night.  That game is HARD... and unlike some people are saying here, it's also still FUN.  Very addicting.  Games pretty much got easy after nintendo.  There were still hard games for the latter consoles, but I think things got way too easy after the xbox\/ps2 era.","c0e6nj1":"i played it last weekend.  was quite fun and well thought out.\n\nYou can climb on anything, vault from one roof to another.  You can vault onto a barrier, grab a wall grip, pull yourself to a roof and continue rampaging.\n\nI have a feeling through it is a bit fast paced for what they planned.  The game benefits running around frantically fragging ppl with grenades.  Hopefully the full game adds a tonne of different weapons that can counter this.\n\nIt will be the must have for the ps3 for sure.","c0e6npz":"there is tax on the playstation network.

Oh and those two programs are obviously run off your computer and show as media servers on your playstation when you boot it up so you just connect to them. hope that helps.","c0e8f92":"Well I am going to put the bad stuff out first.\n\nStory: Greedy Dude --&gt; Wants Power\/peace w\/e --&gt; Awakens Big Bad Monster --&gt; world needs a savior.\n\nGood Stuff \n\nCombat: First off most of the videos you see of this game make it seem slow. Well the combat isn't slow it can be if you want it to be but fast for the most part. You can take a sword use both hands for greater damage or use it with one hand and a shield. You can equip a dagger and a sword and dual wield the weapons. You have stamina which decreases every time you dodge an attack, run, attack and block an attack. All of these have a direct effect on your stamina. So you can't become a blocking whore in pvp. You also take damage and depending on the type of shield it can very little to getting knocked down\/dazed etc. You can take on as many enemies on as you like just remember that they will go ape shit on you i.e it isn't like the movies where only one of them come at you. If you manage to get hit you will take A LOT of damage be ready for that (this depends on armor.) \n\nControl: You control the camera but you can lock on enemy units which locks the camera. R1(attack) and L1(defend) are your main buttons your going to be using. Switching between weapons is a breeze with the d-pad and since this is a playstation d-pad it is pretty damn responsive. \n\nYou will die in this game period no questions asked. I died about 3 times in 30 minutes not because the game is super hard but it punishes you for making mistakes i.e I tried to power swing two enemies at once but one repelled my attack and the other stabbed me with a 10 foot pike. When you die you leave all the souls you have collected with your dead body when you re-spawn so do all the enemies. You will have to fight your way back to your body just remember whatever killed you is chilling there. However, if you manage to get your body you get everything back + w\/e you collected. I have failed to have this happen to me if you somehow die trying to get your body back you lose all the souls you have collected. So be patient.\n\nThis game has given me spooky moments. I was running up this tower and I saw a heavily armored knight I kicked his ass (so I thought) well what appeared to look like him going down I decided to turn my  back on him well the sob was just healing and he pushed me off the tower. Other times everything gets very dark and you get this weird feeling your about to die. I repeat if you get the feeling your about to die there's a good chance you are. The built in messaging system which lets you write messages on the ground(other players can write this also) don't pay attention to all of them! One read that by walking toward the pit I would see a treasure well I did. I saw millions of souls. I jumped for joy and then the floor broke under me and I died. There are also blood stains where you can watch how people died ( my advice is to watch them if your unsure because this has saved me many times.)\n\nLet me know if you want to know anything specific I think those are the most important aspects.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nSomeone asked about loot:\n\n\n\nBasically You have a storage which can store items of every kind up to 999. You can drop items you can't sell items (don't know why but I can't complain). You have item limit which basically limits how much you can carry (this limit increase via your level or when you pump strength up). You also have a equip limit i.e you can carry two extremely heavy weapons which you can access at any time however the result may be that you might not be able to equip a shield which you can access quickly during battle etc. ","c0e8fjk":"It killed me that Shadow of the Colossus didn't come out on the ps3 instead.

I've also been having a lot of luck with the java based ps3mediaserver software.  tversity and ps3mediaserver are free, but playon requires a one time $40 investment.  It is WELL worth it.  I turned off my cable TV and save about $80 a month.\r\n\r\nNote that this ONLY works if you don't plan to record things off cable.  Between the content available on mediamall playon such as hulu, CNN, etc. and the things I download(ahem), I never run out of content.  If you decide to go this way send me a message and I'll send you some plugins for playon that stretches out past 1000s of shows all available online for free!  I can also give you some pointers on where to get TV online.\r\n\r\nMythTV is awesome, but very difficult to set up.  Make sure that you have the right hardware for the job.  You'll need a video card and processor that can handle encoding and decoding video to the standard of your TV (HDTV or SD) and a fairly large hard drive.  You can get a 1.5TB hard drive for $110 that should serve you well for pretty much any kind of content you're after.\r\n\r\nThe MythTV forums and various chat rooms are invaluable in helping you to solve problems, but be sure to read all available documentation before asking questions.\r\n\r\nIf you're not a tech type, I'd highly recommend Tivo, which you can now run from your PC with a package from Nero.  This will enable you do most of what MythTV is capable in a very streamlined way, but the disadvantage is that there is a monthly fee to use the guide service (myth TV does provide this for free, but sometimes the service is down or has issues and this is a REAL pain)\r\n\r\nAlso there is boxee, which runs on a PC or apple tv, is free, and has an awesome 10 foot interface that I found sorely lacking in windows media center.\r\n\r\nSo to sum up, only go with Myth if you're into tinkering with hardware and software.  If you are good with linux, I felt that the linux software worked a lot better than the windows build, but things may have changed since I installed it a few years ago.  Once it is set up, it is AMAZING and very powerful.","c0e8ob5":"&gt;look at the black dude we elected president...

I dont need pop culture telling me what is funny before i decide its funny. Guess that's why I own a ps3 and not a 360, although american society dictates 360 is teh best!!!! American society is largely dictated by pop culture.  Halo and xbox made gaming popular and mainstream, okay for everyone instead of just the nerds and dorks, and thus mainstream gaming became cookie cutter hollywood shitfests with mindless explosions and big gruffy men with guns as the norm.  Fuck halo, I will take my Disgaea 3 and Demon's Souls any day.\n\nI got off topic..also, im high.  \n\nAnyway, I agree with the statement about family guy, and especially about stewie.  You see, in american culture, its becoming very commonplace to shove homosexuality down our throats through introducing and plethora of gay characters in everything, including children cartoons, and is especially over saturated in programming targeted to tweens and teenagers.  Changing stewies awesome original and uniquely funny character to a bland stereotype is in accordance to pop culture standard of having homosexuality at least somewhere in almost anything and everything.  It wasn't like this 10 years ago..  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I dont have anything against gays, but i hate having it shoved down my throat in everything, literally..everything.  characters even change to incorporate this into whatever it can be, and thus stewie is gay now, instead of being original and funny..hes just gay, and if you bitch about stewie being gay, the conditioned response is to immediately assume said person is a homophobe because he dislikes the gay character.\n\nYes, family guy has changed, they destroyed stewie to some degree.  He can still be funny, but hes just not the same.  \n\nIts interesting..you know in the bible it says that in the end of days, there will be a rise in homosexuality in society..  never has such a small group of people (gays) have been made into a huge cultural thing, and put into everything to make it seem like its so much more common.  \ni believe this confuses already confused teenagers and takes advantage of the awkward stages of knowing your sexuality to make homosexuality seem like its completely okay, and common, and deserves to be in everything we consume in the media and entertainment.\n\nIm not religious, and i have nothing against homosexuals, im just tired of having to see it everywhere..literally everywhere, like its such a common acceptable thing, when its really not that common..\n\nSociety programs people to think and be a certain way, and most people can't think enough for themselves to not be affected by propaganda, and higher motives and agendas.  Homosexuality is becoming a lot more common now, since homosexuality is indoctrinating our youth through cartoons and tv shows, its becoming a prominent figure in our society even though homosexuality isn't that common, which is now changing due to what we as a society consume.\n\nPeople can be 'brainwashed' or conditioned to be a certain way, there is science behind this, and these tactics are employed by governments all over the world to control the progress of societal ways.\n\nIts sad but true, and most people can't see this, even though its so blatantly clear.\n \nLike I said, 10 years ago it wasn't this bad.  \n\nI will be flooded with downvotes as most of you wont agree with me, or maybe even understand what my point is and what im really trying to say.","c0e9sya":"Is it important that they come from Reddit?

It's much harder starting now and my gf is kinda in the same boat but learning and now does really well playing.  She can beat my score on house of the dead 3 ;)\n\nPlease don't think this is a troll, but owning a ps3 and a wii, I'd say learn to game on a wii and then go to ps3.  Wii has those old school barebones games we all learned on and will mimic the progression from SNES to N64 (2d to 3d) to ps1 even.  This will help enormously.\n\nI lapsed console gaming at the middle of ps1 cause I hated what new games became (watered down pc games), so I know where you're coming from.  And after ps2 I got a wii and my gf and I play it a lot.  Those wii games that are throwbacks to old style gaming allowed her to learn the patterns and slowly progress to ps3 titles.  \n\nFor example, wii has a firefighter game that's a first person shooter where the enemy is the flames.  Perfect if you wanna get used to navigating in those titles without having to keep track of moving enemies.  Geometry wars on wii allows you to point around your ship and aim - my gf likes the analog sticks better but it is much easier for me to user pointer controls, and I gamed my entire life save several years.\n\nWork your way up.  Mario is accessable to anyone and Wario is too.  Any of their games should introduce you.  Pick some more games you'd like.  Then in a moment of courage try Metroid Prime Trilogy and other first person shooters.  After that RE4.  Then go back to the hd console and try again, keeping in mind analog sticks suck for aiming ;)  They make a mouse for the ps3 that aims and I hear you can use them on xbox, so I'd honestly try that.  To give you an idea of how much easier it is people on ps3 think the fragfx mouse is cheating in Call of Duty.  It's bad enough I refuse to use dual analog and play shooting games with a mouse or on the wii.\n\nFor geometry wars. collect is the key to high scores.  However my gf likes how defend covers behind her - sweep is also excellent at clearing enemies and bait is good at higher levels.  The entire strategy is run from enemies, shoot behind you, and clear paths in front for you to sneak through and loop new enemies in the mob on your trail.  Bomb when this gets insane.  Keep your eyes defocused around your ship and avoid locking on one enemy.  Hope it helps a littlle.\n\nGeometry wars is hard though.  It took me years to learn how to play those 2d shooters well.  I still remember the day it clicked and I didn't waste 5 dollars getting to level 4.","c0eckvq":"Uncharted 2 for the PS3 is releasing this week.

If\/when ps3 piracy becomes possible, developers will definitely lose money.  Resulting in fewer games \/ increased prices for normal customers.\n\nCan't really decipher your question exactly.\n\nIf you meant to ask, if\/when ps3 piracy is possible, is it better to buy a console, pirate most games, and maybe buy a few cheap \/ used ones.  This is a little more difficult.  \nI will use my own anecdotal example.\nI am a pc gamer, piracy is dead simple.  I am an avid gamer.  I love gaming, and I consider the developers behind the games to be artists.  If I were to pirate the games I am interested in, I would be taking advantage of these people and their families.  Even if I can't afford it at the time, that means I need to save up (heck, I can afford a pc\/console).    \n\nMy suggestion would be to try to be a little flexible.

I would highly recommend the game.\n\nOther than that, although it depends on your likes and dislikes:\n\n* Metal Gear Solid 4 - Basically must-have material, and a platform exclusive to boot. If you haven't played any of the series before, bite the visual bullet and download the original Metal Gear Solid off the PSN for $10. You'll get plenty of backstory to get you up to speed.\n* Assassins Creed - Very unique environment and gameplay, and with AC2 coming out it would be nice to have the backstory.\n* Fat Princess (PSN) - If you like online multiplayer mayhem, this is the game for you. Fun, cute and accessible.\n* Pixeljunk Monsters (PSN) - Beautiful and well designed tower defense game\n* Dead Space - Have not played it yet personally, but opinions from people I trust inform me it is exceptional. Play in the dark with the volume up.\n* Disgaea 3 - Do you like insane JRPGs with billions of levels? \n* Killzone 2 - The game which flexes all the PS3's muscles. Visually stunning, it's essentially like the first 10 minutes of Saving Private Ryan throughout the entire experience.\n* Demon's Soul - If you have the maturity to handle a very difficult game, this third person RPG will be rewarding\n* Super Street Fighter 2 HD Remix - Instant classic. Even people who don't typically play video games likely played SF2 at some point in their lives. Either this or Street Fighter IV, or perhaps both ;)\n* Valkyria Chronicles - Amazing anime style real time \/ turn based (what the hell can we call it, anyway?) strategy game. The demo is on the PSN if you're wondering about the gameplay.\n* InFamous - Another exclusive to the PS3 (actually many here are), GTA4 with super powers, notably less escorting and going to the movies.\n\nAs for your \"when released\":\n\n* Assassins Creed 2\n* God of War 3 (and 2 and 1)\n* Dragon Age: Origins\n* Modern Warfare 2\n* Bayonetta\n* Final Fantasy XIII\n* ModNation Racers\n* The Last Guardian\n* Trine (PSN, coming Oct 22)\n* Borderlands\n\nAlso, you'll likely want to download [PS3 Media Server](http:\/\/ps3mediaserver.blogspot.com) if you haven't (not sure what aspect of the \"multimedia aspects\" you were referring to.

","c0en9y7":"&gt;And....your point is meaningless,\r\n\r\nI don't know if you'r ejust acting stupid, let me explain in case you are stupid:\r\n\r\nHow many pepole are willing to chip and void the warranty on their xbox 360s?\r\n\r\nNot nearly as many people who want to download the game, console games are sparse on torrent sites, PC games frequently have thousands of seeders but even the most popular console games seldom make it that far. It's a simple supply and demand thing: Most console owners don't want to take the risk of chipping their console, it's simply not worth it for free games.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow for some cold hard facts [you wish werne't true](http:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/us-software-sales-call-of-duty-4-and-super-mario-galaxy-top-charts-psp-shines-52835.phtml), call of duty 4 for the xbox 360 was the second heighest selling game on its release week. Keep in mind there is no ps3 in the top ten overall, this makes sense as this was early days for the ps3 when it was seriously struggling to find its fooitng.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt Modern Warfare 2 will hit the overall top ten on both the ps3 and xbox 360, however for the PC it will not see it, sure it will be th enumber one game on the PC but it in all likelyhood won't even see the overall top ten.\r\n\r\nConsole ports sell better because very, very few people are wiling to pirate games on consoles.","c0enboe":"And they use the same font for \"Spider Man\" and \"Playstation 3\".\n\nLazy assholes.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.joystiq.com\/2007\/03\/29\/ken-kutaragi-insisted-on-spider-man-font-for-ps3\/","c0enby7":"DoDonPachi Dai Ou Jou is only available on:\n\nArcade\nPS2\nXbox 360\n\nOnly the ps2 version can be downloaded illegally.\n\nIn the meantime, try DoDonPachi under MAME.","c0enhxl":"It tends to vary by game, and even between ships within a game - for a dramatic example, see R-type Final for the ps2: while it draws heavily from danmaku, the ships have a serious variety in hit box placement and size.\n\nAs far as the Donpachi series goes, the hitbox size varies slightly between games, but usually doesn't vary between ships within a game, although the placement will.  To be fair, hit boxes are still 4 pixels or less (I think - I don't own anything past Dai Oujou) in the donpachi games (Dai Fukkatsu has a 1x2 pixel hit box, for instance).\n\nAnother common thing to do in these games is to have a concentrated-fire or slow-down mode, and when the player is in that mode, to show their hit box.  So you can watch videos of some of these games (for an easy-to-see example, see the Touhou games) to get a feel for the hit boxes.","c0eni88":"You can import ESPgaluda for the ps2, and play it using any of the mod options.  They're pretty cheap. And if you mod the ps2, there are a significant number of shooters available for it.  \n\nThe ps2 version includes both Tate and Yoko, and it's pretty easy to acquire arcade controllers for the ps2.\n\nCave has traditionally been pretty opposed to allowing their games to be released outside of Japan\/East Asia, so I'm pretty chuffed about MF.","c0eniyr":"I was best-friends with this kid Jason in elementary school. We were normal friends he was a completely normal kid. He was kind of quit but was a lot of fun to hang out with. We both played soccer for our town and we're in the same class. He was a gamer like me. We played our playstations and nintendo 64s together. Traded pokemon cards. All the normal stuff kids.\n\nHe had family issues but it seemed to me that he dealt with them fine and there appeared to be no problems. His mom was diagnosed with leukemia and was undergoing chemo therapy during the time I was friends with him. She was a strong woman and eventually beat the cancer which was pretty cool. We both went to different high schools and grew apart since then. \n\nApparently his mom's cancer came back. They had all kinds of problems affording her medical bills. Long story short, he poured gasoline everywhere and torched his house with his parents sleeping in the bedroom. They suffered severe burns and passed away in the hospital shortly after the incident.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.philly.com\/inquirer\/local\/nj\/20090425_Teen_sentenced_in_fire_that_killed_parents.html\n\nHe was sentenced to 20 years. To this day I don't even believe he could have done something like this because he was such a nice quiet kid when we were friends and I just can't even see how this stuff went through his head.","c0enmvk":"Well said, though you're painting the iPhone with words like \"restrictions\", \"inabilities\" and \"narrow feature set\".  I think most people who have an iPhone and have used the other platforms, including myself, see the opposite.  The iPhone has what, 85,000 applications?  It can scan barcodes, process credit card numbers, act as an accurate leveler, has full featured art and paint apps (a painting from which made the cover of the New Yorker), works as a remote control for your DVR and stereo, acts as a 32 GB Bluetooth hard drive, more available games than ps3, xbox 360 and wii combined ... the list goes on and on.  I haven't heard of anything Android can do that makes me think \"wow, what I have is really narrow and restricted\".  Quite the opposite.  I don't think the burden of proof is on the iPhone to show that it's fully featured, it's on everything else.\n\nCombine the literally thousands of functions the iPhone has with the apps with it's inarguably superior UI and robust ecosystem, and it's no wonder Apple's competition in this market is taking a daily bloodbath.","c0ennrk":"The port is respectable.  There's some slowdown, as you'd expect from the ps2, but graphically it's very close.  Most Cave console ports add in some bonus features to correspond with Black\/Death\/whatever label arcade versions - Arrange modes, Boss Rush modes, etc.  ESP Galuda has an arrange mode where you play with the ESP Ra De characters - it's pretty difficult.\n\nIt also comes with the standard console bonuses, like boss practice modes, replay recording, rank\/life\/bomb manipulation, etc.\n\nA lot of the ports were created interlaced (for a particularly egregious example, see:  Mushihimesama), so if you feel like messing around with patching ISOs, there are resources around to de-interlace them, which will result in minorly better graphical quality.\n\nIf you end up playing on the ps2, I strongly recommend getting a widescreen TV that you can turn on its side, and the HD video adapter for the ps2.  The adapter isn't expensive, and the additional clarity helps out a lot for those games that support it.","c0ent5n":"If you find bad company for around $15-20, buy that. It's the same game with a modern warfare skin instead of ww2, and BC has 8 maps. Instead of 4, well 3 really.\n\nThe only real difference is the ability to fly a plane in 1943, which is fun. Other than that BC is the superior game. But 1943 is worth the money. The coolest thing about 1943 and BC is the destructible environment, which MUST be experienced.\n\nI can sell you my copy of BC if you have a ps3 for $10, I only have the game disc and a generic case, no manual or cover art.\n\nI wrote a [review of 1943](http:\/\/www.boontobias.com\/) if you want to check it out.","c0entfs":"I'll definitely be buying anything they release internationally, in the hopes that we'll get future international releases.\n\nIt'd be nice to have releases of Death Smiles, Ketsui, and hopefully some of the older games that didn't make it into arcades here.  Especially since I just finished assembling my 360 controller.  All Seimitsu parts for the win, heh.\n\nA fun game pack series that I downloaded for the ps2 a few years ago (\"Multi Games Collection Volume 3 - Shoot em Ups\") had Homura, Mushihimesama, Raiden 3, Gigawings Generations, Ibara, Strikers 1945 I and II, Psyvariar, and a few other crappier games in a single DVD.\n\nIf independant folk on the internet can put together stuff like that, seems like there could be a market for commercial game packs of older games, in the field.","c0eo2dm":"No, the xbox version is the poor cousin.  The Orange Box for PS3 is the red headed stepchild they locked in the cellar and melted down the key.\n\nhttp:\/\/kotaku.com\/5337257\/valve-not-even-bothering-with-the-ps3-any-more","c0eo2ha":"There is a place for well made additions to games and while I have not bothered to purchase any DLC for any games I own I do see the logic in buying new songs for a game like Rock Band.  What I can't tolerate though is ridiculous crap like what Codemasters is trying to pull with the [Dirt 2 DLC](http:\/\/www.ps3vault.com\/codemasters-dirt-2-dlc-is-disappointing-7076) which essentially is paying $10 to complete the game for you.  I would love to see their download statistics for that, how many retards buy a game and then pay $10 to beat it?!","c0eo6qf":"I played the ps3 version of tf2 quite extensively. There were bad lag issues at first but then the problems were corrected and I never had a problem. I stopped playing it however, because EA is a shit company and they decided against giving the ps3 version ANY support. No class updates, no new maps, no new weapons. Fuck EA. You want a good fps on ps3, getchya self a copy of Killzone2 best fps on ps3 hands down.","c0eoc7t":"You know something interesting and sorta related, my friend had his basement flood which happened to be where he stored all of his old electronics. His insurance was structured in such a way that they would pay to replace whatever was in there and if such item was no longer available *they would pay for the current version*. So his old square TV became a 60 DLP, his NES becomes a Wii, his playstation begets a PS3, etc, etc. He also got credit for something like 50 games, peripherals, the works.\n\nCan you tell I'm literally green with envy?","c0eogh7":"So, while Sony appears to sanction swapping the HD in the PS3, and makes the [process](http:\/\/boardsus.playstation.com\/playstation\/board\/message?board.id=ps3&amp;message.id=3592400) rather painless, MS is trying to force users to choke down a [120 GB](http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-us\/hardware\/x\/xbox360harddrive120gb\/) drive for an insane $149.99.  I mean seriously, you can get a [1TB](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B001IDIM1W\/ref=asc_df_B001IDIM1W941085?smid=A18ACDNYOEMMOL&amp;tag=nextag-ce-tier5-mp01-delta-20&amp;linkCode=asn&amp;creative=380341&amp;creativeASIN=B001IDIM1W) drive at amazon.com for 100 bucks nowadays. \n\n","c0eolff":"I think that it's pretty short sighted to try and just \"blame\" them or not. There are a host of factors, all play a role.\n\n1) How a person is raised. Some families make it law that you finish everything on the plate. It's hard for some to get past the programming and say \"no\" to their significant other.\n\n2) Genetics plays a role, this has been proven. Some people store fat more easily than others, some people are able to release stored fat as energy more easily than others. Some people's digestive systems are more efficient than others. Some just never feel full for very long.\n\n3) Some work in a very sedentary job. Lots of hours sitting on a chair in front of a computer, programming, for instance.\n\n4) Some try to lose weight, and fail, several times - not because they aren't trying hard enough, but because they are doing the wrong things to lose weight, and it won't work. Fad diets, overdoing exercise, etc.\n\nI'm not saying that the individual themselves bears no share of fault here, there is always a personal component. It's just easier for some to lose weight and keep it off. Some just never put any on, and it's easier to keep it off than to lose it - get into the right habits early on in life and you'll *probably* be ok.\n\nI don't get too mad about overweight adults. Adults can make their own choices, like doing drugs, smoking, or being unhealthily overweight.\n\nChildren, however ... it makes me mad seeing so many fat kids. They're just not getting a good start at life. Their parents are defending their \"choice\" to not do sports, and sit in front of their playstation all day, and thats criminal. But what are you going to do? Make parents feed and exercise their kids? How?\n\nAs much as the problem is easily defined, it is as hard to solve. There is no magic bullet, no solution that fits all. Education helps, but doesn't solve the problem. Improving the quality of food helps, but doesn't solve the problem.\n\nTax breaks for people who pay for (and go to) gyms might help. Cheaper health insurance. Stuff like that.\n\nWe also need to get rid of all the processed foods, go back to natural foods that will go off if you leave them out for a day instead of this heavily processed and preserved crap that people eat every day.","c0eool7":"Team Fortress 2 also has amazing netcode. I couldn't tell you why personally, but a network engineer guy I know was talking about how great the valve stuff was compared to say xbox\/ps3 netcode.","c0eopah":"I overheard a \"console war\" argument between two nerds arguing whether the 360 or ps3 is better. The 360 guy said \"Do you realize that when the last Call of Duty game came out, there were over 1 billion people playing it online the first night? I had to count the zeros to double check.\"\n","c0eorhf":"Great Dane mix... that's most likely going to be a big god-damned dog...\n\nhttp:\/\/img.metro.co.uk\/i\/pix\/2007\/07\/GiantDog_450x556.jpg\n\nhttp:\/\/www.pups4sale.com.au\/great_dane_03a.jpg\n\nhttp:\/\/www.fordogtrainers.com\/ProductImages\/customers\/muzzles\/wire\/great-dane-william-margo\/great-dane-william-margo-main.jpg","c0eowz8":"I don't know if next Gen consoles will have them. Maybe late next gen like how 250gb hard drives for ps3 are just coming out. Probably about 500gb when they first come out.\n\nOne things sure, it still won't be enough.","c0ep013":"Hoe this helps\n\n1. If it's a 1 player game, share the cost with a friend and share the game. There's nothing worse than a 1 player game just sitting there after it's beaten. If you can't find someone, then wait a few months. Check craigslist or gamestop for a used copy. Make trade offers on craigslist, I've traded countless games there. eBay usually isn't a good bargain, sites like gamefly give you better deals for used games.\n\n2. If it's a psn game, share the cost with a friend, then download on both systems (sony actually let's you do this legally on 5 ps3s).\n\n3. If it's a game like uncharted 2 that is really good and just came out, just wait a month or two, you'll find many used copies everywhere by that time. This happened with gta4, mgs4, resistance and other popular games.\n\n4. Never buy games from stores at full price before checking everywhere online. Slickdeals, dealnews, newegg and others. Example: Bionic commando is a good game that came out this year, on sale for $16.99 at newegg with free shipping.\n\n5. Go to stores like target, fry's and other electronics stores for walk-in specials. Some fry's stores were selling Battlefield bad company for like $4.\n\n6. Use a rental system, note that you will almost never get the new games right away. But they do offer very good prices to existing customers who want to buy the games.","c0ep3dc":"Stuff would come back sticky, scoffed up or have gunk on the game cases.  To be fair most of the stuff being returned in dire shape were xbox or ps2 games\/peripherals, the newer stuff was usually in better condition.  For me, saving 10-15 bucks isnt worth buying something thats beat up or looks used.  I'm somewhat of a neat freak and like clean, crisp boxes...so the extra cost is worth it to me.  To each is own I suppose.  ","c0ep3w8":"Iv been playing fps on consoles for a long time. First it was N64's James Bond 007, then it was Quake 3 on my Dreamcast.\n\nOn all of the earlier consoles (besides ps2) the joysticks were on the left hand side of the controller.\n\nThen came the double joystick controllers (xbox) and they decided to put movement on the left joystick so you can run and jump (using buttons on the right pad).\n\nSo I would say that there are a certain subset of gamers from those days who have problems today.","c0epdaw":"Nope, only ps3 and later they had a psp version too. I've played the shit out of that game over the last few years. T6 will be biggger among xbox owners than ps3 for this reason.","c0eplbt":"Dear PC gamers,\n\nYou guys just want unfair fights. Fights where you will win 80% of the times. While you guys are skewing the play field, the normal pc gamer who doesn't cheat is getting screwed. Wall hacks are not cool if you're the one getting shot at.\n\nEveryone teams up and plays cod with their friends on xbox live and psn. To those of you who say \"We just like a specific server\", quit bullshitting. Just party up with your friends and play like the rest of us have been doing without complaint for years.\n\nAnd being able to choose which map to play on is also sort of unfair if you think about it. Some guns are better for certain maps. Everyone will almost always pick the gun best suited. That's just pathetic.\n\nResistance 2 has custom map\/mode selection for up to 60 players, however those games are friendly matches and not ranked. Do you know why? Because it's easier to get kills in certain maps, obviously.\nFinally, to those who are complaining about bad connection, the system will pick up a new host if there's a bad connection or if the host leaves as seen in the live demo. (Uncharted 2 already does this as some of you may know)\n\nSo please, cry some more. Pirate the game just like Crysis, actually I on behalf of 360 and ps3 owners everywere would like to say thanks, without the pirates we wouldn't have gotten part 2!\nSee you nov 10th, or not\n\nSincerely,\n-bt","c0epsii":"Agreed, or just play games on an iPhone\/iPod Touch, because they are cheap and fun.\n\nMy brother has been hyping Curse of Monkey Island for a long time now.

All you need to do is know how to use a partition editor -- and they have how-to\/tutorials **on** the xda-developers forums.","c0eumr2":"&gt; Latency\n\n&gt; Host Drop Out\n\nI absolutely agree for locally hosted games. This is something you experience regularly in L4D. I wasn't saying that pings will be great and everyone will be happy. I was just noting that given a set of servers, both a person and a mildly competent program could pick the best one to connect to. It's not rocket science.\n\nThat said, while I'm not sure how prevalent they'll be, I believe IW has said that they'll be providing dedicated servers. They just won't be user run. I could be wrong here, but that's just what I recall.\n\n&gt; No community\n\nI disagree here. While we definitely lose the ability to give out IP's to get games going, we gain a new center of access, that being steam or whatever IWnet is. Seeing as how they mentioned full steam support, that gives us access to groups, friends lists and portfolios. Find some kids who you like playing with? Friend them. Get enough friends, make a group (or join one). This goes with clans as well. I'm a member of several steam groups and it makes finding games infinitely easy. I don't have to worry about the server being full and can even chat with people outside the game. This works almost 100% like giving out the ip did, with the added bonus of improved moderation and some extra features.\n\nThe way I see it the focus of the game is shifting to outside of the individual matches, into a space where you don't have to be in a game to be part of the community.\n\n&gt; No Mods, maps, hence no modding community\n\nYea, and this hurts the most, imo. I'm just going to throw out consistent user experience though and leave it that.\n\n&gt; No scrims\/competitive matches\n\nI feel as though steam friends lists have a different set of rules then most others. I have no problem friending someone for a match, then removing them later (granted this is personal, so some may have some issues with this). On the point about irc. If you guys are sitting in an irc channel, you're more than likely part of some community or group - so make a group in steam. Same thing as irc and you can join games directly. As for scrims, it's been a while, but you could just friend whoever you're looking to scrimmage create a private lobby then just have your friends follow you in.\n\nOnce thing I'm not sure of is if you can join games via steam profile, which would make friending people unnecessary.\n\n&gt; Destruction of server ecosystem\n\nThis didn't occur to me, but I definitely see the point. People still use vent, so there's a market for that however I can see that going away as well. I'll have to think on this one, it's interesting.\n\n&gt; VAC is bad - Cheating\n\nI'm not familiar enough with either (or had any bad experiences with cheating first hand), so I'll leave it at that. We have no clue how the matchmaker will work, it might be shitty - it might not. The titanic sucked, so I'm not going anywhere near boats... oh wait.\n\n&gt; No more big games\n\nEven if peoples connections could handle it I don't think we'll even have the ability to do it, it probably won't be an option. That said, and I'm giving IW the benefit of the doubt here, maps were probably built to field a specific number of players, again with the consistent experience. I've heard a lot of tf2 players say they prefer maps with an average amount of people. Maps are built for a set amount of action, if you crowd it too much you lose something. That said, 32-50 player games can get awesomely crazy.\n\n&gt; No competitive gaming\n\nI'll agree that competitive gaming as we know it will change, but I *highly* doubt it will go away. Remember that clans and competitive play still exist on the 360, which hasn't had dedicated servers and it seems to have survived fine. We're also assuming that IW wouldn't collaborate with any existing leagues or competitive sites. On match customization, who's to say we'll need to customize it? Why can't we compete with stock settings and stock number of players per map? Why do we have to disable certain weapons\/perks\/whatever for competative matches. Sure, I'm putting a lot of faith in IW, but by disabling the mod community they've taken on the burden of coming out with a solid game that's balanced and works at a competitive level. There's no solution for spectating yet, but there wasn't for any source games for a while until valve released an update for it. If there's enough demand we may see it.\n\n&gt; Symptom of a larger problem\n\nSo you're saying that the ps3 is a useless platform, since most of the 360 game ports over there are near identical? Each platform has it's pluses and minuses and even if the games were exactly identical (which they seem to be) the PC still offers a lot of value over an xbox. I think the exact opposite is true actually. To save the PC as a gaming platform I believe we need to get closer to the console experience. Developers need to feel more comfortable developing for PC's if we ever want to be a first class gaming system again (and if you think it is, you're absolutely wrong). Developers aren't just going to wake up one day and think, 'Our games sell bajillions on consoles, but I think it's the PC's turn to get our focus'. That's not how these things work. Consoles are easier to developer for, have shown a much larger buying audience and can provide a consistent, solid experience to the end user. To be able to get the same focus consoles do, we have to give some things up. \n\nI did glide over some of your more specific points, but hopefully you get my gist.\n\ntl;dr - a.) We don't actually know how it will perform yet or what else it comes with . b.) Give IW the benefit of the doubt, they aren't trying to release a shitty game - that'd be counter productive (as much as we'd like to think otherwise). c.) steam covers a lot of the ground we lose from dedicated servers.\n\nWell written response, thanks for that.\n\n*Edited: Formatting*","c0eusvz":"Microsoft just LOVES to nickel and dime you.

My friend, who also grew up on the pc, has a 360 which he hardly uses because his computer can handle most games, and there aren't many 360 games that aren't on the pc.\n\ni say go with the ps3.","c0evyel":"Since you already have a PC capable of playing most games then I recommend the PS3. \n\nI wouldn't worry about the xbox failure rate anymore, it seems Microsoft has finally fixed it with the newer models. \n\nI should also warn you that xbox can be annoyingly loud even with the newest models, I haven't played much with the ps3 but I assume it is quieter.\n\nAlso not having to pay for internet service makes the ps3 seem more attractive","c0evyo7":"I own both and I play the 360 a lot more. I think its to risky to buy third party games on ps3, 9 times out of 10 the 360 versions of third party games look and run better. I think the ps3 is only good for exclusive games and Blu-Ray movies.  ","c0evze5":"Yes it does: http:\/\/mediatomb.cc\/pages\/transcoding\n\n\nAlthough if I remember correctly, you need some set up some additional options to enable ps3 support.

Now this is not saying that 360 doesnt have really good single player games, or that ps3 doesn't have a good online community. The fact is, the Xbox has a much bigger install base so therefore there are many more people online. \nI own all 3 consoles, and rarely play the Wii, use only the 360 for playing with friends online and Netlix, but I actually put way more time playing the ps3.

IF your really into shooters.  if not like you said then id definitely go for the ps3","c0ew5qq":"I own both and would recommend the PS3 by a long shot. I find it has a lot more offbeat games like flower, LBP, fat princess, etc. I also find exclusives more enjoyable. Last time I turned 360 on was to play Mass Effect. Currently playing Uncharted 2, and it really is an amazing game, feels like being in Indiana Jones movie :)\n\nI find the online experience to be great on the PS3, maybe it doesn't do things hardcore people need, I'm not sure what those would be though, it covers all my needs. It notifies you when friends are online, allows you to message them, has voice chat, etc.\n\nThe blu-ray is a nice addition, I have watched a few movies on it, it's nice. Also, with the [PS3 Media Server](http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/ps3mediaserver\/) I can stream all my media to it pretty painlessly.\n\nI like the fact that the PS3 comes with wifi built in, and has a large HD, which is user swappable for any standard drive, don't have to pay through the nose if you want more space. The fact that HD comes standard means many games use it and install themselves on the HD, so your load times are a lot better. The wireless rechargeable controllers  being standard is a good touch too. Also, I find it runs a lot quieter than the 360, which has a tendency to really spin the fans up when the action gets heavy, don't know if that's true for newer models though.\n\nSo, to sum up, I like the exclusives for the PS3 better. I think it's cheaper overall, once you add up all the accessories. I enjoy having blu-ray, and free online play. And, I find it makes a better media server.\n\n","c0ew5sn":"The main reason I got into consoles is because I stopped running windows, and I'm going to plug [PS3 Media Server](http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/ps3mediaserver\/) again, I can't say enough good things about it :)\n\n","c0ew6lh":"Yea dude youre a spammer.

If you succeed via method a that means you've screwed over the console gamers, they won't get to play the game when its ready for their systems and instead will have to wait until the PC version is finsihed.\n\nThis is a ridiculous statement. The PC version and console version were available and ready at the same time. The delay between PC sale and console sale was not a product of an extra weeks time needed for packaging, as the retailers received both the PC version and console version at the same time. Which is sort of why I pointed out the \"early sale of packaged PC version\" issue to you. Perhaps you missed that?\n\n&gt;Regardless, I get to play it tomorrow after it gets its EU PC release date. That meant I had to wait two weeks after it got released on the consoles in the states! Well, Amigad, you can imagine the tears I cried every night trying to get by without borderlands.\n\nI am very happy for you. There are actual regionalization issues and supply issue between the the EU release and the North American release. Some of them are technical, some of them are ratings related, some of them are simply sales estimates based on the American and Japanese markets related. This delay, to some extent, makes sense, even though it is still pretty shitty.\n\nHowever! When the PS3, XBox 360 and PC versions of the game are shipped to retailers at the same time, and there is a 7 day delay between when the console versions may be sold and the PC version may be sold, it is very hard to argue that the delay makes sense. It's not a development time issue. It's not a packaging issue. It's not a physical inability to sell the game issue. It's not a brief delay to estimate how many to order (trust me, over the last 2 years of Steam, all kinds of statistics on digital distribution versus box sales have been gathered, and the retailers already know these breakdowns). It's an arbitrary delay. We do not really know why 2K decided on a 7 day delay. Perhaps it was a licensing agreement issue with Sony and Microsoft. Perhaps it was an attempt to push console sales. Who knows? All we know is that product was physically available for use on all platforms at the same exact time, but the release was staggered. \n\nThe point you started out trying to make is baseless and does not jive with reality. The point you have now evolved into making (that whiners shouldn't whine as they won't change anything anyway) is simply stupid.","c0f3etq":"I would argue that the wii hasn't really been part of this generation.

I'll even ignore your dismissive reference to money-management - because as everyone knows, not only are addition and subtraction not math, money management *certainly* isn't one of the primary mathematical teaching tools in elementary schools.  No sir.\n\nAny RTS, turn-based RPG, or tactical RPG requires some kind of numerical thinking to really succeed.  I'll pull as just a single example Final Fantasy Tactics, for the original playstation.  You must accrue, manage, and spend skill points in order to advance your characters, with an eye towards how you many points you're about to acquire and long-term goals on how to develop each character.  That's math, and logic.  Every action you assign a character pops you up a little window that predicts how much damage the action will do, along with its percentage chance of success - if you're attacking, for example, you must calculate how much health the defending character will retain, weigh that against the miss chance, and decide whether or not the attack is worthwhile.  That's math, cost-benefit analysis, probabilistic thinking...I could go on.  \n\nOf course your child's not going to be able to judge distances based on a video game.  That's spatial reasoning, not hand-eye coordination, and you can only gain it from interaction in real space.  I never said video games were valid as a sole occupation.  Again, you're caricaturing.\n\nAlso, and in no way do I mean to judge or insult your oldest child, you're making a mistake common in other debates like that about marijuana use.  I'll often hear \"weed sucks, man, my cousin smokes all the time and he's completely out of it.\"  Ah, but you'll find, often enough, that the cousin in question was out of it from an early age - he gravitated naturally towards an activity people told him would sit his arse on the couch and let him take a lot of naps.  Smart, alert people who smoke weed generally, in my experience, remain smart and alert.  Be honest about your older son - was he a go-getter before he started playing video games?  Can we attribute his lack of initiative to the games themselves, or was he playing them instead of working because that was already his inclination?\n\nLet's not forget, to conclude, that video games (especially for PC) are *very* capable of teaching computer skills and imparting the ability to work in a digital environment - and are we really going to deny the utility of those skills?  Are we really going to pretend you can get them from tee ball?","c0f6dk0":"OMG!

I'm not sure why you would try to output your playstation on anything higher than the hardware you're working with is capable of.

Nowadays, kids are taught to run away, tell mommy, call the police on bullies at school, etc. We have a gang problem in this country because no one can stand up to themselves, and when they are hit up by a gang, the options are A) Get my ass beat because I can't defend myself, or B) Join the gang and not get my ass beat because I'm a wuss. \n\nAlso.

Although its in its infancy and certainly not as good as XBL yet, it'll mature with time. I havent noticed a MAJOR difference in graphics, though there have been some games that do look better on ps3, though, again its not a night and day type of thing. Same thing with bluray.

Too bad it apparently sucks, and is on the xbox, I have a ps3","c0fdsxc":"cool.  what happens is that the electrical current in electrical wires combined with the resistance of the cable itself (like water flowing through pipes) creates a small magnetic field surrounding the cable.  if enough are intertwined or running along side that magnetic cable can interfere with the cables next to them.  This is usually shown through ghosting.  \n\nSo, you have your xbox, ps3 and computer all run via separate cables directly to the tv, and you switch the source on the TV to change what you want to watch? Is the ghosting only shown through the tv source or ALL sources?  Because if you have an antenna that you use to pick up over-the-air TV, and the ghosting is ONLY on your TV source, I am willing to bet 99.9% that it would be your antenna.  ESPECIALLY if your cable from your antenna is long, coiled up, running along AC\/Extension cords, power conditioners or any 120+ voltage device.   Antennas are VERY prone to ghosting or any image distortion, even if they are digital.  If the signal is analog, there are a million things outside your house that can cause these issues.","c0fdt64":"I think its that they don't do anti-aliasing properly.

For the PS3 I own two controllers. I play on a kind of large HD tv at 720p (I could be wrong, I don't know the details too well). For the 360 I own probably 20 games. For the PS3 I own four. This is not because I like the 360 better, it is because I had it first and all of the great cross-platform games I bought for it. Also, since buying a PS3 my gaming budget has been broke, not allowing me to buy new games for it.\n\nSystem Physical Design: The systems are about the same in size, and feature fans in similar locations. Both can easily be placed upright and on their side. However, the 360 tends to scratch its disks vertically(from what I've read on the internet), so its not recommended. The PS3 definitely looks better with its glossy surface, however its prone to gathering dust and fingerprints. The 360 looks a bit clunkier, buts its smooth curves are somewhat elegant.\n\nOverall I like the PS3 design better, it just looks nicer and easier on the eyes.\n\nController Design: This is tricky; I used the 360 first so I've had more practice with it. The 360's controllers design seems to be designed with action and shooting games in mind. In these games it performs wonderfully. The 360 controller fits nicely into my hands. The joysticks allow for quick precise turns, enabling me to play Halo 3 on the highest sensitivity. The controller would be essentially perfect, except for the D-pad. The D-pad is the most infuriating thing on the controller. If I have to use it in a game, I enjoy the game less.\n\nThe Playstation controller is by no means worse, its just designed for all games fairly. Action and shooting games will lose a bit in control, but overall all the genres can control evenly. The joysticks are slightly loser and easier to turn, making games seem less precise. However after a few uses you quickly get used to it. The four buttons feel almost exactly the same when playing games, and you really won't notice any difference. The Dpad is only four way, but it shows you exactly what you can and cannot do. There is no easy to use diagonal, unlike on the 360 it makes that clear. The controller's major flaw is its R2 and L2 triggers. They are awful. They are spongy, take a long time to click, and there is a reason most PS3 FPS don't like using them.\n\nOverall I'd say the controllers are about even.\n\nMenu Interface: The 360 has a good interface with its new update. Information is hidden behind sections, however it lends itself well to the limits of a console controller. The center button opens up an all purpose menu that lets you do just about anything you could on the normal menu, with a few exceptions.\n\nThe PS3's menus definitely look better. I think they are better designed too. Unfortunately they don't provide as much functionality quickly as the 360. Trophies have to \"sync\" which is frustrating, and I tend not to check my trophies now because of it.\n\nIn terms of design the PS3 most certainly wins. In terms of functionality the 360 comes out ahead by a small margin.\n\nCompany in charge: This is an interesting section most people don't focus on, but I think its worth mentioning. Microsoft tends to block free updates (see Left 4 Dead, TF2) on the 360. Sony doesn't seem to mind at all with allowing free stuff through. For me this is significant. Its nice getting new levels and large updates every once in a while. Unreal Tournament 3 on the PS3 recently got 15 new maps, while the 360 got nothing.\n\nWinner is Sony.\n\n\n**Edit: The services section below was terribly out of date when I copy-pasted this comment, I have updated it now**\n\n\nServices: Netflix is awesome. I use it all the time. It now exists for both the PS3 and 360, however the 360 still has a slight edge in terms of usability. The PS3 requires a disc to be inserted to run Netflix, and the interface is somewhat slow and inconvenient. The 360's Netflix application is built right in, and is very fast and responsive. It is actually cheaper on the PS3. The Netflix subscription is $9 a month, and the Xbox Live subscription is $50 a year. To use on the PS3 you only need to purchase the $9 Netflix subscription.  The PS3s photo and music apps seem pretty nifty, but I haven't really used them much. Home isn't that great. Some of the PS3's other apps are kind of interesting, but are mostly novelties and I don't actually use them. I'll add Bluerays in here, those are a great addition to the PS3's capabilities. The 360 is getting both Last.Fm, Twitter, and Facebook integration. To some users this might be a selling point, but once again an Xbox Live gold subscription is required. The PS3 may be able to run these apps somewhat well, for free, through its built in web browser. The PS3's web-browser can be very useful at times, but as can be expected it takes a long time to browse.\n\nA tie. Both have Netflix now, but the Xbox updated with Last.Fm, Twitter, and Facebook. The PS3 still has Blueray playback.\n\nGame Library(Most important section):\n\nThe 360 has a great lineup. Unfortunately though its mostly action and shooting games. It has some incredible action and shooting games though. Halo 3 is in my opinion one of the best games ever in terms of gameplay. It has some RPG exclusives, but none have been terribly impressive (In my opinion). Left 4 Dead is a great game, but its better for the PC and the only reason it might be better on the 360 is if you like split-screen(like me). Gears of War are very good games too, I just don't enjoy them much personally. Mass Effect is also a very good exclusive\n\nThe PS3's lineup seems more varied, which I really like. Out of the four games I own so far, only one is a FPS. The ratio is hardly that good on the 360. Little Big Planet is a masterpiece of gaming to me. I enjoy it immensely, and its replay value really is unlimited. Picture Super Mario Bros. if it could instantly and easily download user-made levels, and how awesome that would be. Little Big Planet is kind of like that, but with more physics. Metal Gear Solid 4 is incredible, and more an experience than a game. It blurs the lines between games and movies. The rendered characters have very well designed animations, and oddly watching them talk for 15 minutes is actually interesting.\n\nVerdict? Well, its a tough call. The 360 is better for action and shooting games mostly. (Killzone 2 and Resistance 2 might be great, but I doubt they compare much to Halo 3, though I can't really tell without owning them.) The PS3 does very well in other genres, and a few of the exclusives are great fun.\n\nMarketplace vs. Xbox Arcade: I cannot really say. I've bought only a couple of games from each. The PS3 seems to have more niche games that are very enjoyable. A few examples are Echronome, the Pixeljunk games, Flow, and Flower. The Xbox has Braid, Castle Crashers, and a few other good games.\n\nOnline: The PS3's online is free, but its inferior. Its great being able to form parties on the 360 and play with other people. Its easier to access information about friends and more intuitive. The PS3 games do have decent online play, but its really up to the creators of the game to provide a good interface for play. For most games PSN is not really up to par. The PS3 also has a halfway decent web-browser.\n\nOverall?\n\nWell, if you like action and FPS games the 360 is the clear choice. For other genres and more trend-breaking games the PS3 seems like the way to go.\n\n\n\n","c0ffvjd":"The last 5 years of my life back. I wasted them playing my ps2\/3 and talking to people on msn ","c0ffzdu":"Oh, quick request for some clarification here.\n\nI'm planning on picking up Dragon Age later today (in a couple hours), and have the option of 360, ps3, or PC. However, my PC is dated (2.2 Ghz, 1 Gb RAM, 7600GT video card). Is the console version really significantly worse in terms of difficulty, or can that be easily adjusted? \n\nI've read that the ps3 version looks a little sharper, but runs worse, so would lean towards the 360. However, the overhead camera would be great, sucks that its only available on the PC. Are there any other major differences you noticed? I've read the kotaku article, so I'm aware of the inventory manegment differences and they don't sound like a huge issue.\nThanks.","c0fg1zx":"The perfect combination. Videogames+ weed\ncant wait for mw2 dude its gonna be tight. 360 or ps3?","c0fg4sc":"I've got both, and i'll say....yes.  Get your XBOX fixed, buy a PS3, and when you get your xbox back, see which one you like better.\n\nYeah Yeah, commence the downvoting, but this is exactly what I did, and I haven't touched my 360 since I got my ps3, which has had 0 problems.","c0fg65e":"I own all 3 systems and I end up playing my PS3 a lot more than the 360.   I think the game lineup is stronger on the PS3 when it comes to exclusives which really tips it in my favor.  The online is great and the XMB interface is superior to the Xbox interface. Xbox does have a nice feature to invite people into parties and go into games as a group, but i've never had a problem inviting friends into games on the ps3.  ","c0fg71g":"I own both consoles also, and the 360 has been collecting dust since Mass Effect.\n\n&gt;First off, the 360 controller may be the best controller design I've ever used. It fits comfortably in my hands and works extremely well for first-person shooters, which tend to be my bread-and-butter. After using the 360 controller for any length of time and switching back to the PS3, the Sixaxis controller just feels like a toy.\n\nI have a completely opposite experience here, I find the 360 controller to be bulky, while the ps3 one fits nicely in my hands, I also like the use of the six-axis in games like ratchet and clank, it's not intrusive, and it adds a bit to the game. Also, like how it has a built in rechargeable battery.\n\n&gt;The game selection for the 360 is, without a doubt, much better than the PS3.\n\nI guess that would depend on what games you play, I find PS3 has by far better exclusives, games like the Uncharted, Killzone, GT5, LBP, Demon's Souls, Folklore, Ratchet and Clank, MGS, Resistance, and Warhawk are really awesome. I mean if you really fucking love Halo, then yeah 360 all the way, but for me Mass Effect was the only exclusive that I actually gave a shit about.\n\nAlso, consider free online play on the PS3, and the fact that their store deals with normal cash and doesn't invent funny money. And if you actually need a bigger hard drive, Sony won't bend you over for it.\n\nTo summarize, I feel that PS3 is by far superior as far as exclusives go, it works as a great media center, it has free online play, it doesn't die on you. I have been nothing but impressed by it.","c0fg9xb":"Thanks, hope the ps3 is free of bugs too. Not sure why people are downmodding your original comment though, after the two NWN games I'm surprised this has been as bug free as it is. Have some free upvote to compensate!","c0fgfaw":"I see your point, but the problem with your system is that it relies on everyone to be good, upstanding people. You might donate a large percentage of your salary to what you feel are worthy causes, but the majority of people wouldn't. Lots of people would decide that a new playstation is more important than some bum's health care. If the government got rid of all but the bare-bones systems, the country would probably fall into chaos.\n\nObviously, the best system of government is anarchy, with the people working on their own to better society, but that isn't going to happen. Any attempt at forcing a utopian government on an unwilling society will ultimately fail. People are lazy and selfish, and they won't hold up their end of the bargain.\n\nAs it is, people in the US are dying needlessly because they can't afford medical care or because their claims have been rejected. It's a problem that needs a solution, and that solution might be found just by looking at our northern neighbor.\n\nedit: For some anecdotal insight on why voluntarism wouldn't work, check out [Not Yours to Give](http:\/\/tinyapps.org\/docs\/not_yours_to_give.html) by Davy Crockett.","c0fgjk4":"You pop the disk in and it gives you a 5 or 6 digit activation code.  You go to netflix.com\/ps3 and plug in that activation code.  I hear if you refresh it, then it just gives you a new activation code.  So the code isn't linked to the disc.  Then just like that your queue pops up on the screen.  There may be a bit of loading time for all the thumbnails, but it's really not that bad.","c0fgsen":"Who cares. It's basically the same engine as the first game, and it would still be a good game with the graphics of quake 3. The visuals now are nice enough, and the game itself makes me warm inside.\n\nHaven't played uncharted 2, but I'm hoping to have a look when my friend gets it. Don't get all this rivalry between platforms.\n\nIt's too bad ME2 isn't coming out for the ps3, I think everybody should get to enjoy the glory of Mass Effect. At least you can download it on steam, I guess most modern computers should be capable of handling it.","c0fgvc2":"im talking strctly graphical.  it would be amazing to see it on the ps3.","c0fh4iy":"Star Wars: Episode 1 on playstation.

I dont think there is anything out there that compares to it.\n\nNow, I have a 360, and I loved the first mass effect, and I will get the 2nd one for the 360.  \n\nI only meant to say that I would love to see mass effect 2 using the graphical capabilities the ps3 has.","c0fh8hj":"hot damn, diverting this thread before it turns into a flame-fest.\n\ni've owned a ps3 since last fall, and just bought a 360 in today's walmart deal.\n\nyes, xbox live is superior to psn.  no doubt about it.  the friends system is much more robust and easy to handle ( i can't even connect to a friends' game in warhawk).  you get what you pay for, which in this case is $50 per year for xbox live and $0 for psn.\n\nboth consoles are great and relatively cheap, compared to last generation, where the ps2 debuted for around $400 and is hardware-ly inferior to this entire generation.\n\n**TL;DR** both systems are awesome and let's avert a dick measuring contest here, shall we?","c0fh8ud":"I agree on every front.  I bought my ps3 and Killzone 2 at the same time.  What a let down.  6 hours later, the game was over, and i was in awe at what an uninspiring experience I'd just had.  Your guns reset after each mission, they are boring to begin with but you don't even get choice.  The enemies are boring as hell.  The story was down right non existent.  And the online multiplayer has about as much depth as a game of poo sticks.","c0fh8y9":"Borderlands doesnt look as good on the PC as it does on the ps3.\n\nI guess if you bought the top graphics card every 4 months and maxed out your ram on a 64 bit system you could say that the PC version is always better.\n\nPC suffers from the fact that most are not willing to do that.","c0fh9jq":"If you have a decent router, you can assign ip address based on mac address.

Mass Effect for PC was ported like a year after and what technical upgrades were made only made it look a little definitiony-er. \n\nWhat I'm with great difficulty is trying to say is that Mass Effect on playstation probably wouldn't look particularly different, but would be great anyway. Reason: Mass Effect gave me the best single player experience in a long time, if not ever.\n\nOkay, I realized what PS3 possibly could improve with it's sci-fi AI processor. The texture glitches. Don't know if it's the hardware, the engine or just sloppy programming. But that is the only possible technical problem I can think of.","c0fhadc":"Characters - tick - they weren't even 1-dimensional, they were subdimensional; plot - tick; visual style - tick.

She brought it up to the counter in an *ancient* Electronics Boutique bag.  I took the controller from her, went in the backroom and checked the security camera and saw where she took the controller off the wall and put it in her bag.  I walked back out and told her to leave my store and I wouldn't call the cops.  She started jumping up and down and crying racism.  I called the shopping center security and they had to drag her out all the while she was kicking and thrashing and knocking over shelves of games.  I think she was on meth or something cause she freaking flipped over an entire dump bin filled with ps2 cases.  I hear meth gives you super strength, although I wouldn't know.\n\nThe biggest asshole I ever had was a guy who came in in March to return a GBA Sp he bought for his son at Christmas.  He claimed his son was simply bored with it and he wanted his money back.  He literally was like \"Fuck your return policy I'm not satisfied!\"  He drove a Porsche.  I guess he thought he was entitled.  When I tactfully told him to piss off he called my DM and made up a bunch of lies and threatened to call the local news channel.  My DM made me return it to get the guy out of the store.  Only time I ever hated my boss.\n\nI had an associate get punched because we were out of 360s at launch.  That was pretty rough.  Along those lines, I had a customer get a security guard fired because he wouldn't let her wait outside of my store on Thanksgiving and she didn't get a PS3 for her kid.  I was there for all three of the current gen system launches.  Those were insane.\n\nLast but certainly not least, we had a woman come in who showed us her goods in exchange for us calling her when we got Wii's in stock.  She proposed it and my 3rd key said \"YES!\" before I could further discuss it.\n\nEDIT:  I just remembered there was the customer who bought me a Wii.  She would always come in to my store spending stupid amounts of money and I called her when I got Wii's in because she was such a good customer.  She asked me how I liked it and I told her I didn't have one because I didn't have the money.  She bought me one on the spot.  I traded it in after playing it twice and used the cash to get another tattoo.\n\nAlso I got to meet Steve-o and Wee Man at the manager conference.  They were drunk as hell and drawing penises all over anything you asked them to sign.  I got Todd McFarlane to sign one of the Halo 3 controllers he designed.

The resulting mayhem was the most amazing moment in gaming history for me. I flew up instead of just stopping I ramped the 90 degree wall and went straight up. I literally hit the police helicopter taking it out and as I started back down towards the ground landed with the cab upside down drivers door facing the wall it landed on the hoods of the two wrecked police cruisers and it exploded right as it hit the two cop cars causing a chain reaction making them explode. during all this i had managed to press the triangle button and had miraculously crawled out mid air and landed next to one of the cop cars moments before the explosion as I jumped the explosion sent me flying over the blue fence of the construction site and a few seconds later the wrecked police helicopter fell on top of my beautiful mess. I was standing in awe for a good 2-3 minutes and me and my two buddies who had witnessed it were like WTF YEAH!!!!! that was efffing insane! Also as a side note has anyone ever noticed in that game that the longer you play the cops seem to get tougher and change up their tactics from time to time?","c0fip30":"it's not a download, it's an install. it's data off of a disc so that the game can run faster and just work through the ps3's hard drive.\n\nthe patches aren't 5gb, the games are.","c0fj4qg":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/hardware\/comments\/a242z\/xbox_360_and_ps3_though_pc\/c0fj4p3","c0fj7bp":"i would say it depends on 2 factors: what you're primarily going to be watching, as well as whether or not you'll be streaming the media from a server.  if you're the type that downloads lots of things, i would personally go with a [popcorn hour](http:\/\/www.popcornhour.com), as it can handle almost anything you throw at it.  if you're just watching your own backups and \/ or purchased discs, i would go get a ps3 and use [ps3mediaserver](http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/ps3mediaserver), it'll do dvd and bluray, and as long as you rip your media under the high@4.1 profile, the ps3 will play close to anything.  the biggest issue with the ps3 is lack of .mkv support, but other than that it functions much better as a media center than the 360, which if i remember correctly requires everything to be in wmv.\n\nas to the issue of streaming media, both the popcorn hour and ps3 require high def content to be dxva complaint (maximum profile is high@4.1), but the ps3 can only take m2ts or mts files, so some remuxing may be required for downloaded files.  the power of your fileserver is also somewhat important.  ps3mediaserver will do on the fly transcoding of any files that are not dxva complaint, and can do lossless 1080p transcoding as long as you have a decent cpu.\n\n**tl;dr** get a popcorn hour if you don't want to deal with transcoding standard definition content (ps3 only handles mpeg4), high definition content must be dxva complaint for both popcorn hour and ps3.  use ps3mediaserver for fileserving to either the popcorn hour or the ps3.  get the ps3 if you intend on buying most of your media, the popcorn hour doesn't come with a bluray drive.","c0fjac5":"I definitely wasn't trying to impress you.

Pitchford has a good point, The PS3 maybe a little harder to develop for, but it's  challenge, and at the end of the day your job just isn't rewarding if you aren't doing something that challenges you. I don't know if the fanboy statement has any real weight, but he does have a point in that, Valve makes more money from the PC, and even the 360 versions of the game compared to the ps3, however, if they started to support the ps3 more then, well the market could swing around and they could be making more money off of that.\n\nYou can't blame the console if you just don't have the resources to code on it, that is just the inability of the company to adapt and change with technology. Valve has done pretty well with this so far, so it is kind of interesting to see that they had such a hard time with the PS3.\n\nFrom where I see it, it just looks like Pitchford is calling it as he sees it, there may be more to it then what he's saying, but at any rate his opinion does have some weight behind it, either as someone who has worked closely with Valve in the past, or just another person who is instead the gaming industry.","c0fjl6m":"More blogspam by Sol.

I knew I'd break out into a tl;dr here... **Here are my observations after years of going to bars and clubs.**\n\n**There are pretty much almost no good lines.** It's like 40% delivery, 20% content, and 40% \"does she already like you for some reason.\" The HARDEST thing is just breaking the ice *somehow*. You could be right next to someone and until you talk to them they might as well be 1000 miles away. I'm sure you know the feeling.\n\nMy general strategy is to find a \"[plausibly deniable](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Plausible_deniability)\" excuse to chat someone up so I'm constantly on the lookout for those types of opportunities.\n\nI have had embarrassingly good success with these after just a handful of drinks:\n\n(said to a pretty woman that I was strategically standing behind, at a crowded bar with a male bartender) \"Mind showing a little leg so the bartender would actually take our order?\" (She was responsive, but unfortunately, engaged. I still suck at checking for that. But she liked me enough to introduce me to all her female friends. Sadly she was the prettiest\/most bubbly one.)\n\n\"You're the prettiest person in this bar\/at this party so I figured I'd go for broke.\"\n\nThen you can do stuff like offer to take people's pictures. Be on the lookout for cameras. Once that's done, the ice is broken, segue into something else.\n\n**Bridal parties** always need random dudes to pull various stunts. This is yet another icebreaker. Watch for the girl with the cheap crown. Ask her group if they need a victim. Segue into something else.\n\nMy buddy had a pretty foolproof system that consisted of bringing a bag of blow pops and offering **candy**. Who doesn't like candy? Bam, there's your icebreaker.\n\nSpeaking of buddies, I've had far more success meeting people when *alone* or with 1 other person than with a group of people. It's just way harder to break out of (or into for that matter) a group. Don't be afraid to be alone (this is sort of my specialty, but I know it's not for everyone).\n\nBars with narrow corridors to walk through or past are best. I think they have good **feng shui**. If you have to get past people, that's more opportunity to chat anyone up about anything.\n\n**Bar real estate basics**: If you get the corner of the bar, keep it! Tons of people will have to get next to you to get a drink. Don't be That Guy\u2122 vulturing near the bathrooms, though. That's bush league. ;)\n\nIn 10+ years of going to clubs (I kinda like techno), I've been able to take a girl home all of 3 times or so. From this I learned one important lesson, other than that I hardly have any game :) . A lot of what I have to offer is talk\/personality. If loud music is playing that I have to scream over, **I am losing**, as an educated person. I am losing to the bodybuilder guy who knows how to dance something other than \"white-guy\". On the bright side, women *definitely* go for decent talk\/personality\/humor... including the pretty ones. While we are mostly idiots fascinated by tits and ass. =\/\n\n**Eye contact**: Twice or more is a good bet. More than 1 second at a time is a good bet. Some women will actually be insulted if you don't take advantage of these types of signals. The eye thing took me a long time to figure out too for some reason. Some guys have these gifts naturally, others not so much I guess, and have to learn them through careful observation and introspection. I STILL have to remind myself when I go out not to immediately lower my gaze when it is met by an attractive woman (I was seriously geeky as a kid). You're the man, you have a lot to offer, feel confident.\n\n**Mood**: If you don't feel chipper, don't bother going out. It won't go that well. The corollary is that if on some random night, even a weeknight, you DO feel pretty bumpin', take advantage of that and go out and show that shit off. People notice that.\n\n**If a woman ever offers you sex** (scenario: hot redhead at party, tons of making out followed by her \"I want to feel you inside me\") and you have to decline for any reason (like, me stupidly wanting to date her instead of just fuck her because I just met her and didn't want to fuck it up), know that you will **never see that woman ever ever again**. Super bad insult to her. Took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that. Instead I was really hurt =\/ My reasoning was something like \"I offer sex to women all the time and they can't and it's no big deal!\" Silly nerd, chicks are not like us :)\n\n**Body language**. Facing you = good. Facing at an angle to you or looking around = not so good. I had a gorgeous half-black woman grabbing my hand somewhat sensuously at a bar... Congratulations, this means \"get the check and show her your awesome 300 movie poster in your bedroom\". ;)\n\nSpeaking of which, \"normal\" seduction touch order (while chatting her up\/making her laugh): Shoulder, elbow, lower back, hip (latter 2 when guiding her through something, they seem to like that a lot), knee\/outside thigh, hands, I think is the rough order. After that you can probably kiss her right at the bar. And then get a room cause you're making me uncomfortable. ;)\n\nI am 100% certain that there are THOUSANDS of opportunities that I missed because I am daft, it went over my head, I was clueless, I was too drunk (...see below), etc. Don't worry, some percentage of the time you *will* get it and something fun may happen.\n\nIf you get a girl's number before the end of the evening and then continue to hang out at the same venue, chatting people up that are best described as \"not her\", you insulted her because you weren't truly interested, you just wanted to scorekeep (I am guilty of this, women seemingly ignored me till I was 21, so the novelty of finding out I could actually get womens' numbers took me a while to get bored of). Change your venue. NOTE: Facebook-friending her on your iphone is possibly the only exception to this, but maybe because it also carries a lot less weight.\n\nI can only deal with a few rejections a night. Like I said, I'm no jock, and I get sore. Go to an area with a few bars so you can hop if you must. If you hit your limit (you'll know), time to swish down a couple more drinks, then take the dudes home and play some ps3\/xbox. Shit happens, you sleep on it, the next day it's all better again.\n\nOne last note: **Leveraging alcohol**, or as we called it in the military, \"liquid courage.\" The most optimal effect happens after only a handful of drinks. Once you start getting pretty drunk, all bets are off (unless the women are as drunk, in which case \"random making-out\" happens, but usually it means you lose game). I have had some pretty funny stories when very drunk, however. Note that about an hour or 2 after you stop drinking you will most acutely feel the depressant effect.\n\n**Post-drinking self-care**: Before you crash, if at all possible, **drink a giant glass of water with a multivitamin**. Then refill it and park it next to your bed. This should take care of any dehydration\/potassium depletion (major cause of hangovers). For the potassium you can optionally also eat a banana or drink a tall glass of OJ.","c0fmcvr":"It's a bad product because it's a port with very little tweaking for the PC.

System is prone to an abnormal high rate of lower then average mean time to failure.  From my point of view it's a pretty big money hole, not saying it's all bad the game play and games are very nice but at the end of the day your overall cost is much higher then a ps3.\n\nPS3, free online play, controllers have play and charge built into them, compatible with ANY bluetooth headset no more having to buy proprietary products.

Now if you have the patience to find one of the older models (I have one that does SACD's and PS2 via emulation not one of the originals that had the emotion chipset built into it) then really you benefit a lot more from your purchase.  It makes an excellent media player 1080p support 7.1 audio support over hdmi.  Graphics wise either system has their benefits.  Yes most games are made for 360 ported to ps3, but ps3 exclusive titles are not made for the 360 and their graphics are very nice.  \n\nReally it's up to you to decide but for what it's worth I find the ps3 to be a more versatile gaming system then the 360 overall.  Not to mention that it's not prone to nearly as many break downs as the 360.\n\n","c0fqsb0":"Just got Persona 4...its like the magnum opus of the ps2's death knell.","c0fqt52":"FF- XIII makes me want to buy a ps3.","c0fqtcv":"a lot of ps3 ports, and exclusive games use quincunx anti aliasing, which whilst smoothing the edge of polygons also smooths the edges of all screen textures too. Look at ghostbusters [ps3](http:\/\/www.joystiq.com\/photos\/ghostbusters-ps3-vs-xbox-360\/2090493\/\/full) vs [xbox](http:\/\/www.joystiq.com\/photos\/ghostbusters-ps3-vs-xbox-360\/2090492\/\/full) as a reference. The xbox tends to use FSAA, due to the way the GPU can do it at virtually no computation expense, which offers better image quality. So yes, it does actually decrease the overall image quality. However, does that really matter to you? all but a handful of cross platform games run fine, and look fine on the ps3.\n\nto answer the original question, about online gameplay comparisons. if you like the online experience you get with xbox, and don't mind paying for the privilege I would suggest sticking with it; the online and community features of the ps3, whilst perfectly functional, simply aren't as good as the xbox. ","c0fqto7":"I have both systems.  Here are some quick bullet points:\n\n* Games that are ported to the ps3 tend to have framerate and graphics issues. However if the developer takes time when making the port there don't seem to be issues.\n\n* Games made specifically for ps3 tend to look better than xbox games\n\n* Players on Xbox live talk more, A lot of ps3 players don't even have headsets, although this is slowly getting better\n\n* Both PS3 and Xbox have netflixs compatibility \n\n* My opinion: ps3 controller better for fighters, sidescrollers.  xbox controller better for fps games, racing\n\n* PS3 has more reliable hardware and built in wi-fi. Although you with probably want to use an ethernet cable anyways. \n\n* PS3 it is easy to replace the ps3 harddrive with a much larger one.\n\n* PS3 up scales dvds, plays avis\n\n* Xbox live is more robust and has better chat capabilities\n\nBut what it really comes down is the online play.  Do you like playing games when all the players are talking to each other? Or do you not like hearing other players?  If you have friends on either system then this is not as big of an issue.  But from my experience I do miss being able to communicate with all my team members on ps3.  That being said I still brought COD for the ps3, due to my friends being on the system.\n\n","c0fqx5t":"I've always been a PC gamer (I still don't own an xbox or playstation or wii of any generation) but I'm planning to pickup an xbox 360 so I can avoid buying a new PC for gaming.","c0fqx8l":"Actually what I see happening way before that would happen is that Computer games will merge into the realm of consoles. Where you will play your pc game on either xbl or ps3's online service.

The 360 hasn't proved that at all since it is only doing ok compared to the ps3, and only then if you consider \"better than the xbox did vs the ps2\" as \"doing well\".  It has not been \"extremely successful\" by any means.  Also, the 360 has virtually no good games, only a glut of casual shovelware that is suffeciently brown and macho to trick frat boys into thinking they are playing real games.  \"It sold ok\" is not the same as \"it has lots of great games\".","c0fr894":"I'm not really trying to convince anyone of anything, just stating my opinion. I'm really a fanboy of neither, and have owned both. The argument is absurd because *in the end* one is just as good as the other, and they're both better than their counterparts in some areas. PC gaming will always be geared towards hobbyists and consoles will always be geared toward the masses. PC gaming will always be better than console because of that huge generation gap. At the same time I think consoles gaming will still \"outsell\" PC gaming because the console is home entertainment component. The masses don't realize things like these *have* generation gaps or see the difference in a $500 computer and a $1000 dollar computer. They definitely don't yet realize it's the sum of the parts inside. To be honest, I was a console gamer before I was really a PC gamer (hate to have to use labels like that). I would play plenty of PC games - I don't even want to know how much time I spent playing Diablo 2. But at that time I had an xbox, friends had xboxes, and maybe a couple people had nice computers. But I gave up on trying to play PC games because my computer couldn't cut it, I didn't have the money for upgrades, I wasn't a hobbyist at the time and an xbox and ps2 were *good enough*..I really don't think that today, $1500 is an expensive estimate for a high end setup from the ground up - starting with zero parts. I'm sure a couple hundred could be saved somewhere, but after taxes and misc crap, $1500 isn't too far off.\n\n&gt;I just don't want to be tied down to a 7-year hardware release cycle, so I don't bother.\n\nNor do I but some people just don't care, or think about that sort of thing. The generation gap is pretty absurd.","c0fr8wi":"That is awesome.  Wish I owned a ps2 but I'm too cheap.","c0frb1e":"You can get some of the older games for pretty cheap.  I've had an xbox360 for a while but took the plunge on a PS3 slim when they dropped the price and loaded up on all the inexpensive classics.\n\nIf you are on a budget, I'd get oblivion since it won't require online play which is a bit expensive on xbox.  It also has a ton of content and will keep you busy for a long time without getting boring.  Hell, try to track down one of these:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gamestop.com\/Catalog\/ProductDetails.aspx?product_id=74866\n\nIts $32.00 for bioshock\/oblivion.  Two amazing games.  You can get GTA4 for around $30 too, so you can have 3 great classics for the price of one new game.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gamestop.com\/Catalog\/ProductDetails.aspx?product_id=64299\n\nI don't want to start a flame war, because I love my xbox360 and ps3 equally, but if you are on a budget, consider getting a ps3.  They've leveled the playing field on system price and since getting one, I've noticed a few key things:\n\n- online is free ($60\/year on live)\n- you can bring your own accessories:\n  - most laptop HDDs work in the PS3 if yours goes bad or you want to upgrade\n  - any bluetooth headset works fine\n  - any usb storage device works for backuping up\/transporting game saves and general system data\n\nMS makes a killing on branded accessories and does not allow for unlicensed ones.  I hate this practice.  It may not be applicable to you.  I think you get a free headset with most xbox packages.\n\nxbox live has the qualitative edge over PSN, but if you are truly on a budget, you cannot argue with free.  I've been playing borderlands and modern warfare 2 on PSN and its not bad besides a few launch hiccups.  There definitely are fewer people playing on PSN.\n\nThere are many cases where there is possibly a slight edge to the xbox on the multiplatform titles, but I really doubt that you are going to notice a difference.\n\nIf you want to get online to play, consider borderlands and Modern Warfare 2.  They are on both platforms.  If you go PS3, I recommend adding uncharted on the cheap.  Of course, if your friends have xboxes, its a no brainer.  They'll likely loan you their old games.\n\nEDIT:  I didn't mention fallout 3 (both consoles) which is my favorite game of the year and will also kill a lot of time.  Mass Effect is a good reason to go xbox over ps3 if you are into shooter RPGs.  It was quite good.","c0frde2":"What post are you reading?  There is no console war here, and there is no \"my kind\".  I pointed out that your example does not support your claim, and that a previous example does.  The ps2 was the least powerful system last gen and sold the most by a long shot.  It also had the most good games.  The wii would kinda support your claim as it is the least powerful this gen and also has sold the most by a long shot.  And it could be argued that it has the most good games, given that the 360 and ps3 have almost none.","c0frfzj":"I think \"ripping you off\" is a bit extreme. I think we'd need more details to go on anyway. Did he ensure you that it was not going to be banned when you purchased it, and if it was he would refund your money, or did he say if it ever gets banned at any point in the future he would refund your money? Because honestly.... a ban is almost an eventuality when you have a modded 360, so if he really did offer a refund if the Xbox ever got banned, that was horribly stupid of him.\n\nI don't understand why he'd agree to the swap for the xbox + $80 and the ps3 either. To be honest both of you sound pretty shady (don't deny it, you're complaining about a console you bought second-hand to pirate games for, and I know you said you don't care about the fact that it's modded... but c'mon, really? You're fooling no-one. Buying something that risks a ban to do what a non-modded console can do is just nonsense, I don't buy it for a second.) and sometimes this is how things go between shady people. If I were you I'd chalk it up to the cost of doing shady things and still enjoy the modded xbox... just obviously not on xbox live. That shouldn't stop you from pirating games however, if anything it frees you up from the issue of needing to stealth things and\/or wait for release day before playing.","c0frh6n":"i use an old ps2 keyboard from like 20 years ago, types like a champ!","c0frk71":"I think I'm gonna skip MW2, I don't play [aiming simulators.](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gaming\/comments\/a421w\/final_fantasy_xiii_hits_playstation_3_this_march\/c0fr0wb)","c0frs7u":"I got banned too.

If people don't want to spend the time and money keeping a decent gaming rig together then it's still their choice.\n\nIf anything I'm grateful for all the console ports. Ten years ago developers wouldn't create their ps2 games for the PC unless they were sure fire top sellers. Since the xbox came along, there's been a lot more interest in making cross platform games, and since the xbox is essentially a proprietary PC this led to games being developed for the PC as well.\n\nSure some of them suck, but theres occasionally something worth picking up. For that reason I can't say I care for the distinction between PC and consoles.","c0frwz4":"Um, they tried that when the 360 and PS3 first came out.  I remember when games ONLY came out for those systems and not for PC.  Console gamers were saying this is the end of PC gaming and this was the console era.  The usual BS about sticking to consoles uncrackable(haha) and PC's get games getting pirated(not to mention the 360\/ps3 hardware was state of the art then, now its affordable for PC's)...for a while anyway.  Then the companies found out a harsh lesson, while they might have lost some revenue from PC pirates(supposedly), when they took out the PC platform out of the equation, they were loosing 100% of potential profits from zero PC sales.  So somewhere along the lines somebody relized that they were shooting themselves in the foot by not releasing on PC, so they started cranking out the PC titles once again.  I highly doubt we will go back to Console only releases anytime soon.  We might get a delay, but PC games will stick around.","c0frxz5":"Yes.

It's trying to desperately say that Microsoft did a bad thing for banning chipped consoles just before the holiday season where heaps of anticipated games get released which is an argument contradicting itself.\r\n\r\n&gt;What Microsoft appears to have forgotten by earmarking this time of year for the banning of modded X-Box 360s is that most of the systems that are purchased this time of year is by parents and grandparents. The game systems that are purchased this time of year are usually done by those that do not have a firm grasp on the industry. Simply put, the systems are usually purchased by people that are fairly clueless about video games.\r\n\r\nSo by banning people who chip consoles, i.e. not grandparents and parents, they're hurting themselves somehow? How?\r\n\r\nWhat Microsoft has done is utter genius, they let many people mod their consoles, then just before the holiday season kicked off with big games (biggestof which is MW2) they kicked in the ban hammer. now heaps of gamers areally want to play a bunch of 360 games, particularly MW2, online, which they obviously can't after the ban. See Microsoft only banned the console, not the account, so these people are more likely to go out and buy another xbox 360 with legit games hence cutting someway into software piracy.\r\n\r\nThe ps3 still hasnt been successfully modded though, so I guess it remains to be seen what happens with the next-gen of consoles.

(thank god!)  As a result, fewer places still have games, and few operators still are around.  If you cold call one of them out of the phone book, and ask them where they have their machines because you'd like to go play them, you'll likely get hung up on or worse.  Not always, some ops are decent folks.  But the reason they won't tell you where they are is because they are skeptical of a cold call.  They are worried you might be a competitor looking for their locations so you can go in and try and undercut them and convince the bar\/restaurant\/putt putt etc to use your machines instead.  \r\n\r\nThe best way to find the games is simply to keep your eyes open.

Food is both insufficient and of poor quality; bathrooms are of a limited number given the overpopulation of prisoner camps; no change of clothes is provided; medical services, already inadequate in the penal system, are even more tragic for the Palestinians. These problems are even further aggravated by the fact that the prisoners are not permitted family visits given that the territories are closed off thereby rendering authorized visits impossible. Even when authorizations are given, the route to be taken by families looking to visit one of the prisons is a risky gamble, being that control points are unpredictable and the duration of the journey impossible to determine. On the date of our visit,  the Red Cross had been unable to organize collective visits for the families, every attempt having been thwarted by the efforts of the Israeli authorities.

They know that no one can predict formation of clouds or precipitation short term nor, of course, long term.  **Thus, this group, by a factor of 20 to one, are not AGW alarmists; they simply do not believe the climate models or the rhetoric** \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","c0g6qip":"NES Max is my favorite.

After discovering half-life and counter-strike around 99 i HAD to have a PC but  was too into school etc to work and just played a friend's. \r\n\r\nAfter discovering PC.  It's multitasking abilities, convenience, and keyboard\/mouse controls i really never touched a console from then on.  Pc's are more expensive but they offer more. As i gamed on PC i also noticed how half assed a lot of console interfaces and games were and they just didnt interest me anymore.  That may sound pretentious but i find consoles are the \"McDonald's\" of the gaming world.  They offer strictly gaming, are isolated from any modability, and serve as an \"off\/on\" experience. \r\n\r\na PC on the other hand again, offers modable games, more rich online experiences, and is just a better medium for me.\r\n\r\nConsoles can have their place but if you ask me, if you want a gaming medium that offers more creative potential, social potential, and content delivery potential, i say go with a PC. \r\n\r\nI think the only reason consoles are still wtih us today is affordability.  I, personally  see no other reason why you'd buy one aside from the pricing.

I used to keep the game in the car for when something awesome was happening.","c0gbpbz":"I have both systems but if I could only have one gaming system it would be an xbox.  Mine gets loads of use (I don't have cable tv so I play it every night) and it's never failed.  I prefer the xbox exclusives like L4D over uncharted 2, and yes I've played both plenty.  The xbox is far better in terms of software.  The menu system is better and the downloadable arcade games, like splosion man and geometry wars are better than anything the PS3 has.  \n\nFinally, the xbox comes with mics.  This is a mixed blessing because the xbox community really is filled with jerks.  However, now that I have a nice group of friends we can communicate with each other, call out bad guys, ask for help, etc.  It's a huge part of the game.  On the ps3 not having a mic is the norm so even if you have one there is nobody to talk to.  People sometimes get one, realize they are alone, and ditch it.  By not shipping a mic with the ps3 it never got the critical mass it needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the ps3 is a blu-ray player so that's part of the reason we bought it.  It finally caught up to the xbox in terms of netflix integration but it does suck that it needs a disc to work. I've had my xbox long enough that I no longer worry (much) about RROD but being on sites like this does make me feel better about the ps3 hardware reliability.  \n\nFor graphics performance, there is no difference.  Don't let anybody lie to you and say there is, they are just fanboys. 90% of the games are identical on both systems while some look slightly better on the xbox and some look slightly better on the ps3.  Also, msft sometimes does things to take care of their customers (or screw ps3 users depending on your outlook) like buy exclusive content. For example, they will get the new mw2 maps before ps3 users do.\n\nAnyway, to answer your original question none of the major console makes have said a single word about a new console coming out.  Rumor sites have said 2011 but now I'm seeing 2012.  Your timing is fine.","c0gbscw":"Well im glad someone pointed out that they didnt include backwards compatibility on the ps3 for ps2 games. Ps2 games look HORRIBLE on a ps3 even compared to running that same game on a ps2. For example I found the video I had seen earlier demonstrating this. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IoCD9TwLrVs\n\n","c0gbtj4":"FWIW, in real life I have one friend with a RROD and one with a broke ps3 so it's even.  Having said that, it's pretty clear from the stats on the web that the ps3 is the more reliable console.  It's less clear to me if the current xbox chipset is less reliable than the ps3. MSFT has made a lot of improvements from the original design but their reputation is still in jeopardy.  \n\nThings have changed. 1) Xbox 360's are more reliable. 2) PS3's are actually cheaper if you need a wireless lan and play online.\n\nEdit: Xbox's are more reliable than they used to be.  I'm not saying they are more reliable than PS3's.","c0gbwrp":"360 and ps3 don't use a PowerPC chip. A brand new core was developed for ps3 and late in the game Microsoft got interested and struck a deal as well. Both consoles run the same core and it is not a PowerPC one.

The xbox has the larger library, only because it's been out longer, and the online play is much better on xbox. However, I prefer the ps3 because the system exclusives are much better, and the controller is just perfection imo. Plus, there aren't that many system exclusives anymore, and the ps3 is a MUCH MUCH nicer piece of hardware. I would highly suggest finding a 60gb model though, because the newer ones can't even play ps2 games. the 60gb's did everything except jerk you off while you ski down mount everest on a plank of wood while a gang of pirates try to catch you and gang rape you.","c0gcbyq":"If you are going to borrow uncharted, do so.

Oh wait, ps3 does that too!\n\n* Want to stream movies over your network from your external hardrive or an old computer used as a media-box? No problem! Windows 7 makes it easy out of the box, or you can use TVersity (free, obnoxiously easy to set up) if you run vista or xp (or maybe even linux now? I'm actually not sure on this).\n\n* Piggy backing on the TVersity thing, you can log in to a hulu or youtube account through TVersity, and then use it to watch streaming media that way too!\n\n* Blue ray? Probably been covered, but at the time of launch, the ps3 was the cheapest blue ray player. Today, although that is no longer the case, the ps3 is still comparable (price wise) to any other blue ray player on the market. The only difference is that the ps3 is a fucking ps3, and not just some boring blue-ray player.\n\n* Oh wait, you might want to actualy play a *video game* on that new ps3 you got? Well get excited that ps3 has been blowing both the wii and the 360 out of the water in terms of ps3 exclusive titles, in addition to the growing number of shared platform titles. Some exclusives to get you thinking: Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, Uncharted 1 and 2. \n\n* $299. You could either buy a blue-ray player and build yourself a media-box for a lot more work and hassle, or just buy a ps3. Kinda sells itself. \n\n\n* No xbox live bullshit. If the game has online multiplayer, you get to play it. For free (except for any mmos i guess?). Add 2 years of XBL ($100), and you now have the exact same price as the \"wildly expensive and overpriced ps3\"\n* Lastly, I would want to add how beautiful they look. I've got the old humongous one, but the shiny finish always makes me smile. The new ones are even more slick looking, and I've heard that they run a little quieter too (this wasn't ever a problem for me, unless I had the ps3 on without the tv on...which was never...)\n\nHope you look into it!

The Playstation arrived on the market a while just after the SNES. In fact, it was originally comissioned to be the 32-bit CD system for SNES(Famicon), but Nintendo scrapped the project. Sony continued the project and thus was born the Playstion. However, the playstation was desgined to be an add-on drive to the SNES and the drive was hastily made a stand alone machine. Namely, the vents for the machine were on the bottom. This wasn't a problem for most people. But anyone who placed the console on something that would block the vents, like a carpet,  could encounter problems with the machine overheating and possibly damaging the machine. This is obviously poor design... I mean who doesn't know a gamer who's at least once put a console on a carpet. \r\n\r\nNintendo continues to create solid products that function fine and are innovative enough to push other console companies to push their innovation. See wii remote and then project Natal. you'll still be able to play their systems 16 years later. Of course, there may be disc issues, which is why Nintendo scrapped Playstation in the first place. They don't like discs for a couple of reasons (some for piracy protection). Hopefully with storage media and consoles changing they'll move back to a more solid state system. \r\n\r\nThe Xbox issue is not a case of modern consoles failing us. It's a case of poor system design (and it seems it may also be poor customer care in some cases). I think Xbox is great, but for now if you want to buy a microsoft console, get a PC. At least then when you're troubleshooting it, you might learn something useful. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yes, SNES was awesome. We actually found the SNES early in our parents closet. So we pulled it out and cut out the Styrofoam to run the necessary wires out of the machine while still in the packaging.(no heat issues, lol... Like we cared.) It blew our minds. And when Christmas came, we finally got to hook it up to the big TV and play it. ","c0gknqt":"Neither of you apparently know how soft power works.

It was then when I heard a dog or gnawing at a bone, or something being licked to death.  Cut scene in, as the zombie turned towards me, in slow motion, with blood dripping from his mouth, I nearly shit my pants, as I sat in front of my 16 in. tv in horror, hoping the zombie wouldn't come out of the tv to bite my face off.  I turned off the tv for a few moments just to make sure.  At the time of release I was only 12 years old, and had not seen any game come to this level of horror.  \n\nI had played games with blood, and gore, and guns, and everything else, but this game stepped it up to a whole new level.

It was, hands down, the most expensive thing that I had ever purchased.  But as I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited for the oft-promised, but never discussed Final Fantasy game for the N64.  1997 came and the new Final Fantasy game came with it.  Directly to the Sony Playstation.  I'm sure that I wasn't the only eighth-grade boy standing in front of his entertainment center with teeth clenched and tears in his eyes, confronting the betrayal of that dark grey, curvacious wonder machine, laughing back at him as if to say \"I'm the better system, but some one else has the better games. Tee-hee.\"\n\nI was disillusioned with the console from that point forward.  In 1998, Valve released a new first person shooter, Half-Life.\n\nAlso in 1998, I was becoming a man.  I was learning to drive a car.  I fingered a girl for the first time.  I traded my N64 to a friend for a CD player for my car, while my homies were rollin' with tape decks (the CD player didn't work, but that is a story for another day).  I put video games behind me and rose up to accept my new found social status.  I had arrived.  And my father finally upgraded our family computer from the 286 running DOS to a shiny new Pentium(whatever-number-they-were-up-to-at-the-time).  It took my brother about 3 days to learn how and where to download pirated software and begin catching up on the PC gaming that I had been missing out on in the '90s.  Amongst a stream of unremarkable and unrecognizable PC games, Half-Life was downloaded.  \n\nMy brother graduated from highschool and moved out of state for college.  I finally got my hands on a Playstation (money became easier to come by after grade-school) just about the time that the PS2 was making her beautiful debut into the lives of greedy fingered rich children, who could afford the astronomical (at the time) launch price of two hundred and ninety nine dollars and ninety nine cents.    I was finally reunited with my beloved Final Fantasy series, which had left me at the alter, holding a bizarre three-pronged controller.\n\nAs I was losing myself in the city of Midgar, I recieved the following email from my brother: \"holy fuck dude u gotta play fuckin halflife now its so fuckin owesome man!!  serios get off that playstation shit and git on dads comp now i dled it like a year ago and never played it much do it its fuckin awsummmmmm\"  In college, he was not studying English.\n\nIt certainly would have taken more than that email to remove me from my Playstation, and as you can imagine, I was not impressed.  I happily finished the remainder of my high school years playing almost exclusively Final Fantasy and Tony Hawk titles on the Playstation 1.  As my brother before me, I also left home for college.  Unlike my brother, who's mind wanders more to the sciences, I found my collegiate destination in the Humanities.  \n\nGoing overseas to college meant leaving my NTSC television and PS1 and embracing the PAL systems of the British.  I didn't know it at the time, but when I left for college, an era ended.  I would never again play my Playstation 1.  I packed it into the same box that I shipped it away in when I sold it on ebay 5 years later, and put it in the closet.  To temporarily fill that void, I downloaded a SNES emulator and went on down to nostalgia town.  My laptop wasn't up to snuff in the graphics department and state of the art PC games weren't going to happen.\n\nMy professors were some of the most intellectually intimidating people I had ever met.  All of them had published multiple books and journal articles and traveled the world giving lectures in their various fields.  One particularly interesting professor taught various cultural theory classes, and unbeknown to me, was pushing to get video game theory wider acceptance in higher education.  He was a sharp, 60ish Frenchman who just wreaked of... Frenchness.  He sometimes wore berets.  He would break into French in the middle of his lectures or quote french writers without feeling the need to translate.  He was personal friends with Jacques Derrida.  He just looked like he needed an accordion and a baguette.\n\nOne day I stumbled into his class late, after a boss battle had gone longer than expected in Final Fantasy IV.  As I walked in, he stopped his lecture and said in a very French manner, \"Misour Deellon' 'as better theengs to doo than attend thees lecture in a punctuale' manner-r-r.  Misour Deellon', please, tell us what importan' acteeveetee are we interupteen by requesteen' your pr-r-resonce in class today?\"  To which I replied with a wink to my classmates, \"Sorry Sir, I was playing some Super Nintendo and lost track of time.\"  His response changed how I look at gamers forever.\n\n\"Super Nintendo?  SOOP-PAIR NEEN-TENDO?\"  Misour Deellon', anyone who is seeting in thier dormeetoree playing Soopair Neentendo... ... ... I ... ... ... Anyone who is not playing Half-Life 2 right now is a fucking eediot.  Misour Deellon', please take your seat, and after class, please join the rest of us in the new century.  It's beautiful here.\"\n\nI was blown away.  After class, I took his advice and spent several hours downloading Half-Life 2 on a shitty, spotty wi-fi in the library.  When I finally loaded it up, my graphics just couldn't take the heat and I had to set aside playing a game that I KNEW must be great, if this man had so strongly recommended it.  I watched practically every video game website blow smoke up Valves ass for this game, and there was nothing that I could do to get my hands on it.  Until the next year.\n\nMy new roomate bought a brand spankin' new desktop, and said I could use it whenever (we were already good friends, and he new I was a gamer, and he knew that my laptop blew ass for games).  As soon as he gave me the green light, I went out and purchased a legitimate copy of Half-Life 2, so as not to expose my roomate's computer to my crimes of file sharing.  About two or three hours into the game, I was blown away.  I was blown away (it was worth saying twice).  However, my OCD kicked in and would not let me continue until I had revealed all of the backstory which I somehow knew I must be missing.  I stopped playing completely, and made it my mission to find a legit copy of Half Life 1.  By the time I found one, my roomate was no longer my roomate, and his computer was no longer my computer.  \n\nOnce again, I was parted from Half-Life 2, and we would not be reunited.  The few fleeting hours we spent together would, however be etched into my brain for years to come.  When I finished college, I purchased a PS2, and soldiered on without a decent gaming computer.  I even purchased Half-Life 1 for my PS2, but playing it, knowing that I had no way to follow it up with HL2 was just depressing, so I never got more than about 4 hours in.  \n\nI pretty much left PC gaming behind forever.  My PS2 eventually became an Xbox360, and when the Orange Box came out, my same old OCD chimed in \"You can't play HL2 until you beat HL1... You can't play HL2 until (*ad infinitum*)\".  Now the Orange Box is available new for like 17.00.  I have a PC that can easily run HL1 or HL2.  I still play games avidly.  I guess the only reason that I never caught up once I had the opportunity is because I'm alone, and I'm embarrassed.  My professor's words still ring in my head every time I see Gordon looking back at me from a box cover in Gamestop.  *\"Fucking eediot.... fuckin eediot.... fucking eediot...\"*  I look away and pick up whatever other piece of shit game caught my eye that week.  You could gift me a copy, but I honestly don't know what I'd do with it.  That old OCD won't let me play it, that old French bastard will just keep calling me a \"fucking eediot.\"","c0grvax":"Did you read what the app did?

Global distribution, and fair prices for each country... \n\n\nI live in Venezuela, and an xbox360 **game** here can cost as little as 700 BsF! Which is to say, $350!! That's about 100 gallons of milk worth here. That's as much as a minimum wage monthly salary, and about 1\/10 what my (middle-upper class) family makes in a month. With restricted currency exchange, importing games for a fairer ~120BsF. is getting tougher each year. Having said this, i don't, and never will, mod my xbox.\n\n\nWhich brings me to my second point... You can't make it hard to pirate games, but you CAN make it unappetizing. Look at what MS does, for example; if i ever mod my xbox, i will probably not be ale to enjoy XBL ever again!\n\n\nNow, while my xbox remains un-modded, i am sadly forced to look for other alternatives with my Wii, and Nintendo DS, until i am able to obtain games for a fair price here, or move to a country where i might.\n\n\n\nP.S.

I can see at least one political motive which may drive GW campaign - individual carbon footprint, which in my opinion is another way to control population on very deeper levels.\n\nOnce again, I'm not denying climate change, I'm not denying human influence. I just want to point out that I didn't see any prove that human mankind contributes to climate change any significant amount.\n\nFor example, if 1000 units of \"something\" is required to change global temperature by 1 degree, humans may contribute 10 units, or 1 unit, or 0.1 unit or any other amount which is currently unknown. \nI'd like to see some research which is not just trying to come up with some sort of correlation, but provides clear scientific proof that it's because of humans' activity we have this climate change.","c0guvf6":"&gt;I recommend to read this: http:\/\/rps3.com\/Files\/AGW\/Rutan.AGWdataAnalysis%20v11.pdf \n\nOK. Let's start at the beginning: yes, he is not a climatologist, he does not have any background in the relevant science. \"Data analysis\" without understanding the underlying physical reality should be seen as a very weak approach.  You are **more**, not less, likely to make errors if you don't know what the numbers represent and just treat them as numbers. Sorry, but I do take the authority of a thousand climatologists over that of an airplane designer.\n\nOK,  by page 7 he makes it clear that he really is arguing from a political POV. I sort of understand this: he does not like the proposed solution, so he rejects the science. I understand it, but it is a non-rational approach. And if you reject that, then consider that he considers all academics as biased. That pretty much cuts out all scientists, that cuts out pretty much all people who have actually studied the climate and understand the underlying physics.\n\nOn page 9 we get that standard libertarian rationalization: companies are dishonest, but since they want a profit it is OK. \n\n(As a side issue he make a claim about the Ozone Hole and CFC that I have never seen before and can find no support for. \n\nOK, starting on page 13 we might have some science. And we start off with a serious problem on his part: he talks about complex **data**. Sorry, but the data is not what is complex, the explanatory models, and the underlying physics, is complex. The problem with climate models is there are so many factors to consider and they interact in non-linear ways. (To put this another way, we have a variety of feedback systems, both positive and negative.) I am sorry and the guy is pretty good in his field, but airframe testing is not complex by this standard.\n\nPage 16 introduces a common serious misconception about the climate and warming, one so obviously wrong to someone familiar with the system that I am rather surprise he got snookered. Yes, human caused CO2 is a small % of all greenhouse gases. So what? Let us take a very simply look at the atmosphere and its interaction with biota. To a first approximation animals give off CO2 and plants consume it. Then animals consume plants and we have a cycle. This gives us a roughly (this is a simplistic presentation) dynamically stable cycle. Let us call this amount of CO2 X. Now human come along and we start digging up sequestered carbon (coal, oil) and putting that in the atmosphere. Call this amount of CO2 Y. That is going to give us warming. The value of X\/Y is irrelevant here, what matters is the shape of the curve *at the moment*. (As a second issue he ignores that the current greenhouse gases are why the plant is not frozen.)\n\nOK, new error on page 17. It does not matter if the CO2 level is \"high\" or \"low\", what matters is how it is changing. If the level was higher in the past and the planet was warming, how does that refute that the increase is warming us now? He also ignores that hundreds of millions of years ago biota was adapted to a very different atmosphere. Yes, global warming is not going to kill everything on Earth. In fact, the deaths of 90% of all individuals and the extinction of 20% of all species wold not be considered a major extinction event. It would sure matter to us humans, but on the geologic scale it is meaningless.\n\nI'm getting tired here. He presents error after error that are already dealt with by climatologists. I am sorry, but having a familiarity with the models and the science really does help.\n\n\n&gt;I can see at least one political motive which may drive GW campaign - individual carbon footprint, which in my opinion is another way to control population on very deeper levels.\n\nI don't get this. You go from imagining a possible motive for someone to accusing an entire field of fraud. How about this: maybe they start with the evidence first and drew their conclusions from that? Somehow absent any evidence at all about actual motive you draw dramatic conclusions.\n\n&gt;I'd like to see some research which is not just trying to come up with some sort of correlation, but provides clear scientific proof that it's because of humans' activity we have this climate change.\n\nWe have what we have, not something we would like to have. Not having perfect data does not mean we should toss the best conclusions we have. \n\n\n","c0guwr8":"good thing they are not focusing on one stupid little thing... it's not like the company who they are in bed with now, Microsoft, didn't release a console with, what was that red ring of death failure rate again?  something like 25-50% depending on your source?  yeah, why would YAHOO focus on something so. frickin. dumb.  if you are gonna rant about the ps3 there are much better arguments - like it is harder to develop on and the cell processor is now a dead end road so developing for it is also a dead end road.","c0guwsw":"Actually, 1 out of every 18 people bought a ps2, and 2 replacements when the previous ones ate shit.","c0guwtz":"There appears to be a way to do it if you have a Blu-ray disk burner:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ps3news.com\/PlayStation-3\/video-ps3-bd-j-blu-ray-java-running-through-a-bd-r-disc\/\n\nI haven't done this myself but I remembered it existed and found that link.\n\n","c0guz2n":"you know, it's cheaper to just buy a new ps3, which comes with controllers.","c0gv0g7":"You can't speak for all of you.

D-. It managed to get the name right and proposed a website with the same name (cafesupreme.ca) but in the wrong country (i'm ok with that). But when I tried to add it to the contact, only the email address had been pre-entered. Phone number and name where empty. Useless.\n\n* A person. Black on white, Name in blue, blue and red logo. D-. Again super annoying. On the search result I can see it got the name, phone number and fax number correctly (not the email and mobile number). When I add to contact I get the name filled in and the only the fax number. (last number detected apparently). Blows.\n\n* A card from an insurance company (AXA). (I think I realized that it wants me to hold my phone right side left and that it was scanning backward).... Detection is great. Name, all three phone numbers, email and website are detected properly. It also detects the company logo.\n BUT once again, when adding to contact I only get one phone number (the last one detected it seems), the name and email. Email has a spelling mistake in the form of a L instead of a I, classic.\n\n* Another card I just can't get anything out of. The font is black on white but slightly smaller. It only recognizes garbage.\n\n* Half white on black, Half black on silver. Worked just as well as the black on white. Recognizes the number but only adds one to my contact.\n\nLast issue, when I add to contact, it's automatically a new contact. No option to add to an existing contact. The detection is roughly on par with other software on the market but the ergonomy blows.\n\nWhen the GPS is active there's a small clickable icon on the lower right side of the screen which brings up a list of nearby landmark. It worked but that was present in google maps before so it's nothing new.\nI haven't tried taking a picture of a business.\n\nAll in all, I think it's a really really promising software.\n\n*Edit* Sorry for the spelling mistakes and crappy grammar.

I've played the hell out of my ps2 controllers and while one of them is a bit wonky, it actually felt a bit wrong from the start.

Is this because I don't play FPSes?","c0gvhhl":"Normally I would agree with you, but the Playstation 3 is not so:\n\n* Bluetooth for all wireless addons. For instance, any cellphone headset will work.\n* Controllers use bluetooth too, but you can also connect to the ps3 with any standard USB-mini cable (and therefore also mooting the point from the article. If the wireless battery *dies* you can still use the controller. I would suspect that to take years of continous use though.)\n* PS3 use any standard 2,5\" IDE drive as storage space. I switched out mine with a cheap 250GB one. In contrast, the Xbox 120GB harddive will cost me more than the standard 250GB one did where I live.\n* Any standard USB thumb drive will also work\n* In addition to MP4, it supports DivX (and Xvid). Streaming media is very easy. Set up media sharing from Windows Media Player and the PS3 will discover it.\n\nWhat irks me is that if you connect the PS3 controller to your computer, Windows will detect it fine but the controller doesn't work. Sony should really create some official drivers (there does exist unofficial drivers and reportedly works excellent).","c0gvj1r":"is reddit being targeted by a ps3 marketing campaign?  they're playing it pretty well this time.","c0gvji3":"I don't think she was implying the battery pack in the controller wasn't rechargeable, just that, like the iPhone, once the battery no longer holds a good charge as it ages it isn't a user-replaceable part and you must buy a new controller.  \n\nEven that doesn't appear true since a quick Google search turns up a scan from 2006 of the [PS3 manual page](http:\/\/playstation.joystiq.com\/2006\/11\/12\/ps3-manual-shows-us-how-to-replace-hdd-and-battery\/) showing how to remove the battery from the controller.

The online content isn't free but, PSN still isn't as good as XboxLIVE from the perspective of things offered and stability(having seen many and many games played on a ps3 online at my friend's, i have to say that i haven't seen so much lag on the LIVE network). The console by itself is cheaper than ps3, and since i don't care about watching blu rays, i could easily drop the blu ray reader. The games graphically compared are often better on the xbox360 since programming on a ps3 with 5 cores is definetely harder than programming on the xbox which has a processor with just 3, and a better graphic card than the ps3. \nAs you can see there are plenty of reason, last of all the fact that xbox, offering pretty much the same things at a lower price(beside the LIVE network that on the other hand offers a betters service), for which i prefer xbox. \nI think that the only choice, in the end, is based on you taste.

I also see your point on the acceptance of planned obsolescence. With this built-in battery, the PS3 cannot have the same lifespan as a well-cared for ps2 for example. The controller could be continually plugged in after the battery dies, but then it loses that wireless functionality. More easily replaceable batteries would allow the PS3 to continue on with complete functioning for much longer.\n\nI guess it comes down to personal stance. I am satisfied so far with the controller, but then again, it hasn't reached the end of its life yet.

Still, adding a 3rd party repository couldn't be difficult.\n\nThe point didn't make any sense because it's not the kind of thing MS could use to destroy profitable tech markets. I just don't see the big issue of Windows have a list of URLs to check for updates and downloading updates if any are found. I'm not talking about MS setting up some kind of global apt-get-like repository that would sit on their servers.\n\nThere's very little money or innovation to be made from keeping software up to date and it's exactly the kind of boring OS functionality Windows should be providing (e.g. xbox, ps3, iphone all have stuff for this).","c0gwhov":"weeks i have been nothing but impressed with both the battery power and life span of my ps3 remotes","c0gwj09":"No. It is not a problem at all.

I only recently got a ps3 slim and I've played it probably less than 20 times, and I actually want to sell it. I don't think it's a matter of me being completely lazy. I will admit that a bit of it is of course. Finally I was reading online about minor things annoying people with adhd, and if that is really a symptom then that applies to me.

I touch the button (but don't actually press it) really quickly and the space around it,. It feels like I'm de-staticking myself, and I do this everytime I have to press a button on the microwave button..\n\nAlso, just a couple days ago.. My brother had his son in his arms, and he was passing him to my arms.. As I was reaching for him, my nephew shocked me (FREAKING LOUD NOISE IT MADE!!!) and if he had passed him to me, I would have probably dropped him because the shock scared the shit out of me,\n\n\nTl;dr : I'm really afraid of getting shocked by static..

I know that [SetCPU](http:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/showthread.php?t=505419) is.\n\nI cannot recommend that app enough.  Especially since the Droid is already underclocked by default -- you'll get a \"snappier\" experience out of SetCPU.  And the use of power profiles will get you an extended battery life by further underclocking the phone whilst in sleep-mode.\n\nAlso -- if you're \/\/that\/\/ worried about apps...  if you have a terminal app installed, there's a little trick you can use:  Dynamic links.\n\nHere's what you need to do -- from a terminal.\n\n`su`  \n`mkdir \/sdcard\/app`  \n`cp \/data\/app\/NAME.OF.apk \/sdcard\/app\/NAME.OF.apk`  \n`rm \/data\/app\/NAME.OF\/apk`  \n`ln -s \/sdcard\/app\/NAME.OF.apk \/data\/app\/NAME.OF.apk`\n\nWhat you're doing here is creating a shortcut in your NAND flash (internal memory) to the .apk file on your SDcard.  It's a poor man's Apps2SD, in other words.\n\nYou \/might\/ get a read-only error.  IF that happens, hook your Droid up to your computer and use adb to execute: `adb remount` -- and once you're done inputting the commands above, reboot the phone.\n\nTechnically, you can do the same thing with the dalvik-cache entries, but that'd really slow your phone down.\n\nAlso -- note that .apk files will not have the same name as appears in your \"app tray\".  SetCPU, for example, is \"com.mhuang.overclocking.apk\".  You can get a good list of what apps are in your \/data\/app directory by using the `ls` command.","c0h1upc":"awesome, thanks!\n\ni checked SetCPU earlier this morning, but it still says that there's no Droid support in the Market. i'm going to try it anyway once i root this thing later today.\n\ni really appreciate the dynamic links instructions. that is awesome. looks really easy to do that instead of messing with Apps2SD.","c0h1xm8":"Heh, soon you'll know whos playing on a PS3 then.

","c0h5ky5":"Source?  I believe your figures are wrong, according to vgchartz.com goldeneye [sold](http:\/\/www.vgchartz.com\/games\/game.php?id=877&amp;region=All) 8.09million copies, while Halo 3 [sold](http:\/\/www.vgchartz.com\/games\/game.php?id=6964&amp;region=All) 10.5mil...  (MW2 has already sold 11.16million copies on the ps3 and 360 alone, and is projected to sell 15-20 million, it nearly beat Goldeneye which has been on the market for more than a decade in 24 hrs.)\n\nI don't understand how an N64 game factors into a DLC conversation.  And is there no \"long term word-of-mouth\" for MW2 and H3?  Then how do you account for the fact that once they've been out for a decade they could easily double or triple the sales of Goldeneye (nice unbiased selection of game btw, you want to prove a point about sales don't pick arguably the best party fps ever released, and then be wrong about it selling as much as COD or Halo..., pick a random 3rd party fps...)  Your argument makes no sense and doesn't seem to fit on this thread at all, it seems to be the product of some long held resentment against modern day video games and media hype in favor of \"classic\" games on the n64.\n\nOn the topic at hand, I have to agree that DLC is getting out of hand.  That said, as long as devs keep it fresh and don't get away with charging exorbitant amounts for map packs that could've been included at release, it's not necessarily a bad thing.  GTA IV is a good example of this, liberty city stories, orginally intended as dlc, is as worth it if not moreso than the actual game.  As such, I have no problem shelling out the extra cash for it, and actually appreciate both stories being developed and released as DLC.

The guy killed someone and he knew that there was the death penalty in his state for the crime, so maybe he should have thought about that before whining about being given a second chance. Homicide is not a trivial crime. Frankly, it's not as if he went to trial once and was then executed. He probably went through quite a few appeals and all the judges found him to be guilty numerous times. It's not as if one person decided - a great deal of judges and juries felt he deserved that fate. \nFrankly, the death penalty is a money-saver for law-abiding tax-payers. Here in Canada we have to pay to keep serial killers like Bernardo in jail for the rest of their lives, chilling in solitary with their playstations, never having to work or do anything at all. And they get free education. Great justice system we have here. At least some of you guys in the States have the balls to eradicate useless members of society.

My old TV was a 32\u2019\u2019 60Hz Samsung.  The noticeable differences will be mostly in any movie or as everyone says video games (thank you playstation 3 for your contribution to man).  Blu-Ray blows my damn mind though; the clarity of motion is mesmerizing.  TV shows will not look much different with the 120 Hz kicking.  The 120Hz at first doesn\u2019t look natural but your eyes kind of learn to get used to now and sometimes when I\u2019m driving it looks like its 120Hz lol.  I say for your situation tho a 32 inch wouldn\u2019t be the better way to go, make it the bigger.","c0h918l":"i would have absolutely no reservations about doing this, but i think most places record the serial numbers now; and I'd hate to be stuck with a new ps3, since that would mean rewarding sony for their shoddy hardware.\n\nalso, wouldn't most ps3's on the market now be the slim model anyway?  still, i like the way you think.  :)","c0h97ap":"I remember long ago with the playstation when I used my index and middle fingers to press the buttons but that resulted in aches after a while\n\nNow I just use index fingers only. In the middle of both buttons on PS style controllers and on the triggers with xbox ones","c0h98kh":"Depends on the type of game. For the 360, it's index fingers for both buttons. For the ps3, it's index fingers only for shooters that use R2\/L2 as the shoot button, and both for pretty much everything else.","c0h99lt":"This really should be some kind of evolutionary chart-- it's clear that nintendos 1983 was a huge event in controller evolution, essentially killing of the \"atari\/magnavox\" branches. The next major change comes with the playstation--- ironically, a system intended to be under the Nintendo family umbrella. ","c0h9aoj":"Monoprice.com has cheap HDMI and component switchers if you have more sources than inputs, and cheap long cables as well. Ideally you have your gear in the back of the room close to the projector and the screen in the front of the room. The only potential issue I see is the Wii sensor needs to be close to the sceen, but I don't have one, so I'm not sure. If that's the case, you have gear by the screen and a long run of HDMI and component to the projector, or if you're going all out, get an av receiver that takes all inputs and upconverts to 1080p through HDMI for a single cable run (this is what I have, and no problems with a 35' run from my denon avr890). Get a usb extention cable and hub if you need to for wired controlers\/peripherals.  \r\nAs far as storage goes, I have all my gear in a hallway closet and installed some radioshack DC fans to exhaust hot air to the attic. I can control everything with no line of sight using a [Harmony 890](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-Harmony-890-Remote-Control\/dp\/B001L1RSO8\/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1260917422&amp;sr=1-2). If you're trying to keep everything in a single room, which is probably more practical for a rental, I'd just use some type of open (that ps3 needs to breath) utility-type shelving that's tall and thin. It might not be pretty, but its a fucking man cave right? Cover it with a shower curtain or something.  \r\nFor game storage, it doesn't get much more minimal than something like a [floating shelf](http:\/\/lifehacker.com\/368814\/diy-invisible-floating-bookshelf). Assuming it's ok for you to put a couple holes in the wall, just use an old game case on the bottom instead of a book.","c0h9az9":"The ps3 copy protection has not been cracked, and seen as not worth it as blu ray burners and blu ray disks are really expensive. As well as the bandwidth to download a single game.\n\nBlu-ray cost is dropping sharply, so I don't know how much longer it will take before there are cracked ps3 games.","c0h9c3x":"Amazing horses, but [*The title is set for release on April 27, 2010.*](http:\/\/au.ps3.ign.com\/articles\/104\/1049861p1.html)","c0h9dir":"Harsh.  Cars break down all the time, everyone knows it but they continue to buy them.  Why?  Because it is necessary for us to have a car to get to work and go shopping and whatnot.  It's the same with the Xbox.  All my friends game, and they all have the Xbox.  Even though they are prone to failure, I still need one because I love games and I love to play with my friends.  My friends would much rather spend $200 (or so) on an Xbox than $500 or more for a halfway decent computer.  So they all go the cheaper route, and I follow.\n\nNot to mention the fact that they would mess up their computers and have to seek professional help to get them fixed.  The Xbox has the RRoD but all in all the service model for the Xbox is a lot less complicated than the service model for something like a computer.  \n\nYou probably noticed that I did not mention the PS3.  I have a PS3, but I use it for solo gaming mostly.  Why?  I have 30+ Xbox friends and 0 ps3 friends.  Nobody that I know (besides my Dad) owns a PS3!  ","c0h9dmr":"In college, a study group at a friends house. Taking a break from the books we turned on the playstation and popped in Tekken 2. Girl I have been friends with for about a year at this point comes over and says that looks fun, proceeds to wipe the floor with everyone else in the house. Been married 6 years now.","c0h9iyu":"Tim is a great programmer and truly lives for this stuff, I think everyone even in disagreement with his perspective should pay attention. I am not familiar enough with REYES to really have formed an opinion on this one but I agree that hybrid techniques become more and more plausible by each day.\n\nUncharted 2 makes a good joke of the current game visualization trends by adding a Next-Generation Filter into the unlockable graphics mode extras. It turns everything a nice hue of brown poo, illuminated with soft bloom.\n\nI'm also one of those people who immediately disable the full frame fake motion blurs (delay frames) where possible, but also the \"cinematic filters\" that do nothing but add noise into the picture (Mass Effect, I'm looking at you!).\n\nI would love to see proper depth of view controls as I have a design for a game that would deal with miniature models, but \"macro camera\" is still very expensive to implement on most architectures.\n\nAs always, it's not just how one or two techniques is used, though, but how well a game can maintain a consistent style and abstraction. Sometimes simple things can work surprisingly well, like how Super Mario Galaxy makes everything appear constructed from quilt patches, plastics and laminated surfaces. It's amazingly consistent and attractive, and runs flawlessly on previous year's hardware.\n\nI also urge you to check out [3D Dot Heroes](http:\/\/www.joystiq.com\/2009\/08\/20\/from-softwares-3d-dot-game-heroes-does-pixel-art-ps3-style\/) which does a very clever twist on npr visuals.","c0h9jqw":"Thanks for the downvotes.

Therefore as your physics background might tell you, if the keyboard's PS2 cable data drivers are sufficiently powerful and\/or the PS2 cable is not properly terminated (impedance mismatch) and\/or the cables are not shielded the voltage level transitions will be strong enough to generate wideband RF, which will radiate. Such voltage level transitions can even ring the PS2 keyboard cable like an RF tuning fork. The PS2 cable is then a dipole antenna radiating a pulse for every voltage level transition. With a proper tempest receiver antenna and amplification and you'll read data on the data lines as if it was connected to an osscilloscope, noise permitting. Just play back the received data slowly with an ASCII table handy. \n\nI said \"resulting from the CPU waking up\".

I've played pretty much every good multiplayer game out there(for pc atleast), and the only one recently that really felt satisfying to snipe in was the beta for bc2 on ps3.  You can pretty much snipe across the entire map although there is a huge bullet drop which forces you to estimate the distance and shoot to compensate for the drop which makes it so much more satisfying to nail a headshot.  Keep in mind this is for the ps3 so I don't know how the pc one will compare but when it comes out it's a definate buy for me.  For older games and games that are actually currently released the rest of the thread has pretty much got it covered.

However, I also attribute the xbox as the largest cause for the mainstream gaming boomers that have risen over the years.  They obsess over first person shooters, sports games, and games of amazing hollywood type hype.  \n\nThey are unrefined, and completely clueless when it comes to appreciating and understanding the technicalities that is the art form of videogames.\n\nI have no hardware preference, but i despise the majority of the XBL community.  TRUE gamers are few and far between on xbl, and they are drowning in a sea of mainstream retards who mindlessly blow the shit out of each other while spewing forth the most ignorant, racist and just downright fucking retarded shit into their headsets.  These guys are not gamers, they are faux gamers, as you have put it.  My preference is the ps3, as I proudly take no part in the shitty XBL community with all the ignorantly fake shit talkers, the mainstream \"manly men\" exclusives and all the general bullshit hype behind all of it.\n\nAt least on the ps3, I can play online with TRUE gamers who actually relate to me, and understand the same points in gaming that I do, the points worth understanding, the valid aspects that make gaming great for those who truly know it.\n\nI've been gaming for over 2 decades, all of my life I have been gaming. I grew up playing japanese games, on japanese consoles, and the majority of the gaming culture has derived from these games and consoles, and is the TRUE consistent gaming culture which has persisted throughout all of the TRUE gamers childhoods up to this point.\n\nNOTE that I am not addressing the TRUE gamers on XBL, as I know you are there..you are just so vastly, VASTLY outweighed by faux gamers, that theres really no point, but the point is.. Xbox Live is the cancer to the once valid and refined gaming culture. Most xbots HATE japanese games, the very games that has molded the culture throughout the lives of TRUE gamers.\n\nMost XBL players only started playing games when it suddenly became socially acceptable, and not associated to losers, and dorks and outcasts, althrough I would gladly accept those titles if it meant it would keep all the frat boys and jocks and general unrefined morons out of my gaming community, which is the only thing I had when I was growing up.\n\nFuck the 360 community, I hope it fucking dies, I hope all these jocky faux gamers just fall out of this cultural fad and go somewhere else, and leave games alone, because they are vastly diluting the culture, and influencing game developers, while discouraging japanese games.\n\nFuck all you xbots.  Most of you are completely fucking retarded. Not because of the machine you play on, but because you literally don't have a fucking clue to what a real gamer is, or what a real GAME is for that matter.","c0hael2":"Don't let these guys get you down. There are others who understand your viewpoint entirely, im not the only one.  Ive had discussions and talked about this topic many many times with people who also grew up apart of the gaming community, playing the good games of ages past.  These guys don't fucking get it, because they are probably the very type of gamer you have described.  Those who know true gaming, and the true gaming culture know EXACTLY where you are coming from, as it is HIGHLY apparent to how much shit has changed over the past 2 or 3 decades.  Only those who have lived the life of a true gamer understand this, and most of these people disagree because they just can't see it the way we can.  You are not alone in your views, i promise you this.  Maybe try the ps3.  It was a lot more expensive, so you know only HARDCORE gamers would buy it over the cheaper console.  The community is great, they actually understand games..you can actually talk to them without being called a fag 100s of times a day.  It is the saving grace of the gaming community, as it is a community of MOSTLY hardcore gamers, wheras XBL is mostly FAUX gamers.\n\nTo those who simply do not agree, I really don't care.  You obviously lack the capacity and the experience to understand where im coming from.","c0hafhn":"Its irritating to see your lifelong hobby and culture taken over and overrun by people who don't truly get it, and hold you in contempt for being a true gamer, and not conforming to the sudden surge of unenlightened and completely moronic mainstream viewpoints.\n\nFirst, gamers were made fun of for being gamers,  now, gamers are made fun of for not conforming to the massive hordes of retards who have begun to take gaming over.  Its frustrating to see the very people who grew up making fun of you suddenly infiltrating themselves into the hobby in which they used to use against you, then just rip it apart.  I am thankful for the online ps3 community, it seems thats all thats really left when it comes to the true gamers, and the true gamer culture which has always consisted up until the emergence of the xbox culture, which now seemingly represents all of gaming to the developers, and to everyone else in society who don't play games.\n","c0hakfm":"Why oh why would you disgrace the ps3 with a third party controller? not only are they ugly, but they are shitty. \n\nMy goal is to have a black, red, blue and silver controller.

I'm not saying it's a walk in a park, but jail doesn't strike fear anymore","c0hcxcw":"Sounds like Ninja Gaiden but even more frustrating, which I think would leave me crying over a broken playstation 3.\n\nMight just get it.","c0hcykv":"Well . .a \"really good\" pc is going to be about 4x as much. . . so. . .\nIf it's for games only, I would get a ps3.\nIF you want a really nice multimedia center type of thing (which includes great games and such) and you have the cash, I would say get the PC.","c0hcyqn":"I definately see your point. \n\nI only have about 40-45 hours in on the game and I've only been invaded a hand full of times. I didn't see a single invader until at least 30 hours in. By then it was actually a great way to add a twist to the game. \n\nThe game is good about making sure you don't get invaded by people who out level you. So when you do get invaded you can be sure you have a fighting chance.\n\nAll that considered, I agree that it would be great to be able to turn off the feature from within game. There are times that I am farming, or at a critical point in a level and just really don't want to deal with an invader at the moment. \n\nP.s. I bought a ps3 2 weeks ago just for this game. I was definitely not disappointed. The game is hard at first... but once you learn it you are very well rewarded for your time and effort. It's a rare game that keeps challenging you enough to make it fun and interesting while not just beating the shit out of you until you want to quit. \n\n\nP.P.S Don't even bother listening to this ZP review. It's clear by his lack of knowledge in regards to the basic functionality of this game that he didn't get past the intro levels. Is putting 5 hours into playing a game your reviewing really too much to ask?","c0hcz8u":"well if you're looking to play final fantasy (including the upcoming ones and earlier) than go for like a 40 or 60gb PS3.  you can also play modern warfare 2 on it also.  plus it's free online play.

But it really comes down to your setup at home and your lifestyle in general.\n\nIf you have a wicked entertainment system and easy access to it then i would go ps3 or xbox.\n\nBut if your in a situation like myself where the family wants to use the tv more often then not then go with PC.\n\n","c0hczvb":"well aware, but I'm saying if he wanted to play previous FF games from the PS2 era than a 40 or 60gb ps3 would be the way to go.","c0hd02y":"Reddit really isn't a good place to ask this question; the gaming subreddit is **heavily** biased towards PC gaming so take that into account at the end of the day.  \r\n  \r\nIt all depends what you're into.  I'd say that ps3 and 360 are pretty much functionally equivalent; almost all games are released for both platforms (with a few notable exceptions) and you can pick either up for about the same price.  Without knowing what you're looking for it would be pointeless to name one over the other.  Unless you're a hardcore gamer I'd pick a console over a PC.  PC's are more expensive and are harder to use (updating drivers, troubleshooting BSOD's, versus just throwing in a disc).  The upside of PC gaming is that there's alot of great games which would never be released on a console, but unless you have another need for an expensive PC or are planning to play for a serious number of hours I'd go with a console.  \r\n  \r\nAnother consideration is how much you can budget for games.  New games cost about the same on all 3 platforms, but consoles have a HUGE used market where you can regularily find great deals.  Also, if you pick up something new for $60 and find out it's not for you, you can generally get a substantial portion of your money back selling it on craigslist.  \r\n  \r\nEDIT: Typo","c0hd0i0":"ahh xbox? we've got it for ps3. either way, crazy as hell that we were having the same thought over the same game at the same time. ","c0hd4n4":"Well you already posted this, so you must have a PC already :p\n\nIf you do, have a look into sticking a decent graphics card in it: the rest of the components matter so much less. Just find out the specs of the pc you already have, and then either post here, or on toms hardware forums to find out which cards will be compatible. The only things you need to worry about would be compatibility with the motherboard, and if your power supply is strong enough.\n\nIf you don't already have a pc, then yes, it probably will be a bit more expensive than a console, but not as much as some other posters have imlplied: usually when people buy a new pc they buy a new monitor, whereas when they buy a console they don't buy a new tv, and this makes up a huge chunk of the cost.\n\nIf money's no object, pick up a core i5, a gtx2**, and a whole bunch of RAM, and then you'll be able to play pretty much any game at full settings at high resolution.\n\nAlso, the PC has the most games. Consoles actually don't have very many 'exclusive' titles, they just shout more about it. Lot's of xbox games come out on PC as well, and there's quite a few ps3 games coming out in the future that will play on the PC as well, e.g DC Universe Online, and The Agency.\n\nIn fact, the number of console exclusives coming out in 2010 is fairly small; 13 out of 190 games (not counting wii games) cannot be played on a PC.

Chances are it wasn't an attack on you\/your house mates, but just a opportunistic crime.\n\nI was broken into in April, same deal - my ps3, games, laptop, camera, video camera, spare car keys, paperwork containing personal information, etc. were all taken. They left my big screen tv and a few other valuables, so I imagine someone had scared them off. I was living by myself at the time, so coming to terms with it was difficult. Later that night, they came back to try and steal my car (which i had at work during the day). I heard them, and chased them down the street with a hockey stick. Also, I knew they'd taken the key, so I had swapped cars with a friend in case they came back.\n\nLuckily for me, I was completely insured. But that didn't help how i felt about being broken into. For a while, I was convinced it was a personal attack against me (had recently gone through a messy break up), or targetted towards my belongings, but after a while I realised it was just an opportunistic attack.\n\nAbout 6 weeks later I was broken into again, but this time nothing was missing. I assume it was the same people coming through, to clean up on insurance (luckily insurance hadn't come through yet), but having them back through the house made my feelings resurface and stress levels went through the roof.\n\nFor weeks after both break-ins, i was edgy, jumpy, and felt very alone in the world despite having friends live only a few minutes away. I didn't want to leave my house for fear of it being broken into, and every day at work I stressed if I had locked up properly, or if someone had forced their way in. \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, I noticed some fresh damage to the window that was originally used to gain access. I think it's the same people, as the exact same method of access was used. They didn't get in. I'm still unsure if i'm annoyed that they've come back, or if i'm happy that my increased security measures have worked.\n\nI've now got a 4-camera surveillance system outside my house, and I'm looking forward to them trying again so that I can submit it to the police and maybe help get this scum off my streets.\n\n\n\n","c0hdi29":"[Naughty Dog hates this too.](http:\/\/www.psxextreme.com\/ps3-news\/6183.html) They give you one free pass, after that you get fined $40,000 in game cash every time you drop during a multiplayer game in Uncharted 2.

The way people get caught is they leave their torrent client on all the time and allow a torrent file to upload to others.  What you do is this.\n\n1) obviously get a torrent client and find a torrent to download\n\n2) when you receiving the file, go ahead and allow it upload.  when torrents are being downloaded, they report back to the site it came from its statistics.  if it reports download and no upload, it will report back to its home site and that home site will communicate with other torrents not to give you their piece of the file.  Then your IP gets ID'ed as a \"leecher\".  Then you're fucked until your ISP rotates your IP again.\n\n3) now when you complete downloading, REMOVE IT FROM THE client and delete the torrent file from the computer.  No uploading from your client.\n\n4) now in the case of a slow download, space it over a few days.  What I mean is say you have a torrent you want that reports it will take 3 days to download.  Download it in the middle of the night.  Say between 10PM to 5AM and then turn off the torrent client. Why?  Because the people who get nailed are constantly running their torrents at all hours and ISPs can find them pretty easily.  Even with rotating port numbers.  It might take 4 or 5 days to get it, but it will be safer.  \n\nWhat the ISPs are looking for (if they are looking at all) are the uploaders.  And the uploaders they go after are the ones who pay for the lowest tier of internet access offered (the 19.95\/month crowd).  If you pay for $70+\/month for maximum up and down speed, you chance if getting fucked with are pretty remote, unless you are stupid.\n\nPORN\n\nPorn is hit and miss.  They only people who bitch about porn in torrents are the people who own those clips4sale.com (store 8178 is awesome by the way) and other like sites where they sell porno clips.  They bitch because someone paid for a clip, and then packed in a torrent and uploaded onto a torrent site.  \n\nThe free sites are virus and malware loaded.  The free sites make their money by turning your PC into a zombie bot and use it to do shit for other people.  Illegal shit most of the time.\n\nAnother problem with torrent porn is it is usually virus or malware loaded.  Avoid anything that only plays in Windows Media Player...and NEVER accept a \"license\" to play any content.  You'll be accepting a tracking cookie.  VLC is a good player and I will say 99% of the malware\/virus stuff loaded into a media file will not work.  However, the media probably won't work either...not that is would in the first place.\n\nAlso to note....the govt is also known to upload real kiddie porn into torrents to nail pedobear crowd.  They will not malware your system, but they'll get a tracking trojan.  It is basically the same thing as a BOT for a spammer or a person setting up a DDOS attack, but it is just send listings of files and your windows config files to a govt server on a regular basis.  This trojan is also a web usage tracker\/logger and everything the target surfs will get logged and sent to a log management\/SIEM type of server. Using Linux defeats a lot of their work.  But most of the public uses Windows.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nEDIT: \n\nP2P\n\nAlmost forgot about P2P.  You can pretty much hang this up.  While popular for several years, what the record, movie, and their contracting companies are doing is basically deploying thousands of servers on the Limewire and other P2P networks with bogus files.  Essentially, they create files that are sized correctly for an MP3 or AVI file but when you download it, it is literally full of random text characters.   So you spent 5 or 6 hours downloading a bogus file.  They do not even waste their time tracking IPs anymore with P2P software.  P2P will probably be totally gone in 2010.  \n\nUnless you are part of a private P2P network, just uninstall it from your PC.  It's worthless.","c0heocx":"I had to throw my very old TV that kept me so busy as a child\/teenager\/college student because of this noise.

I recommend you try to run the ps3 at 720p.  No way to be sure until you try it but the LCD should (and I can't stress enough should but may not) auto adjust the input to fill the whole screen.\n\nEDIT: I took the liberty of downloading your monitors manual.\n\n\"AV signals\n\u2022 &lt;4 : 3&gt; - Displays pictures at the 4 : 3 aspect ratio.\n\u2022 &lt;16 : 9&gt; - Displays pictures at the 16 : 9 aspect ratio.\n\u2022 &lt;Screen Fit&gt; - If a 720P, 1080i or 1080P signal is input in HDMI\/DVI input mode, the picture is\ndisplayed as is without truncation.\nThis can only be set when the external input is connected through HDMI\/DVI and &lt;PC\/AV\nMode&gt; is set to &lt;AV&gt;.\"\n\nSo you can set your monitor to fullscreen your 720p PS3 signal to fill your monitor.

While the Wii isn't exactly the best system for hardcore gamers, in my opinion it is the best companion for a hardcore PC gamer.  Most of the games worth looking at on the other consoles have a port for the PC.  The Wii has great Nintendoey exclusives, and it filles the \"multiplayer in one room\" experience that the PC just can't provide.  Are you asking for games for you or for your girlfriend?   There may be a few others you like, I've spent many hours playing games that I know are stupid simple games, but are fun to play with others.  Rayman Rabbits games were good.\n\n3rd party games that you may be interested in would be RE4, Okami, Madworld, No More Heroes, Muramasa.  That's pretty much it for third parties, really.  The thing is, No More Heros is hard to find, and it's $70 or so where you do find it.  An overhauled HD version is coming to PS360, and it may be best to wait for it there if you have one of those.  Madworld is mature, but it only gets mention because competition is so light.  If it were on ps3 it would have hardly gotten much notice.  It's a short game too.  Okami is available on PS2.\n\nThe Nintendo games are the main attraction.  Mario Galaxy, Twilight Princess, New Super Mario Brothers Wii, Paper Mario, Mario Kart.  I don't know your taste regarding style but at least these games are well made. The best deal is the Metroid Trilogy, 3 games at a great price.  The situation is the same as with the Gamecube, there was only a small selection of real games worth playing on it, but at least the Wii has perfect backwards compatibility and you can pick those up for cheap.","c0hu8ds":"I'd like to give you another possibility: Often piracy is done out of convenience, rather than malice\/cheapness.\n\nIf you buy a DVD;\n\n1.

People are willing to pay(and millions are paying), based on the success of netflix, but the game has changed. The movie industry will have to adapt, and is adapting.\n\nNetflix isn't available in my country, but I pay for a streaming service for the same reason: I want to watch the movie I want when I want to watch it, and I don't' feel like being threatened or called a thief exactly *because* I didn't download the movie I'm watching. Streaming video services are more convenient than torrents; They present 0 risk of being sued or having your internet cut off; they're more cost effective than overpriced rentals (which in some stores are approaching the cost of a new DVD! 10 bucks for an overnight rental? Thanks but no thanks!).\n\nI've spent hundreds of dollars on Steam as well, for the same reason. It's far more convenient to buy the game legitimately than to download some seedy torrent and hope it's cracked. By contrast, the local video game store is still selling state of the art games like SiN and Oni.","c0hu9g2":"I used a wood sword to do the same with my ps2.","c0huafz":"stick to ps3ms and blueray 720p rips, they're usually about 4gb and you don't need to burn them - stream them from your PC using ps3ms.","c0hubty":"Yeah I know, thats the sad thing about the orange box, it's produced by EA and valve and they are total microsoft butt-plugs.

On the PSX?\n\nI think you have to be an old gamer, who experienced going from the 8 bits, 16 bits up to the first playstation games, with their crazy polygons and HUGE sizes, to really appreciate the impact when FF7 arrived.\n\nI was blown away when I bought and played FF7 originally. The graphics were ridiculously amazing. I remember watching the intro with the speeding train pulling into Midgaard and being awestruck when I realised this wasn't cinematics, this was the ingame graphics. Today, those blocky characters look crude and ugly, but back then they were so fucking cool.\n\nThen there was the size of the game. It just went on and on. I think it came on 3 or 4 CDs. And as I went further and further into the game I was confused, I'd been playing hours and hours, maybe 10 or 20, and I still hadn't finished the first CD. When I eventually left Midgaard I had to change to the second CD and I realised that each CD had as much or even more content as the first one. The game seemed endless. The world had no bounds. I still have that feeling to this day, that this was a huge world. A whole planet.\n\nAnd then there were those animated special move thingies you pulled off during the battles. Sumoning Leviatian, the Knights of the Round, etc. When I think about it today, it sounds so stupid that the game would just play these elaborate overcomplicated and much too long summoning sequences in each battle, but I remember when playing the game, and replaying it, those sequences never got old. I would watch them over and over, marvelling at the epic feel and the beauty of the animation.\n\nFF7 was an amazing achievement of a game when it arrived on the PSX.","c0huxy5":"strange i want it for ps3.....","c0hv6p1":"...

Even if you just install a program that just wastes processor speed, and uses the disk drive to write and re-write fraudulent data (what most people would mistakenly call a 'virus'). That is not hard to do. NOT HARD at all. This is what PC 'virus' makers do. Then they charge you to remove it with their software. It is a money game, not a malice game (for the most part). If you can target 90% of people, instead of 10% of people, even if only 1% falls for it, the 90% group is still going to yield more monetary returns. Yes, this is sleazy, but macs just do not have the user base to be a viable target yet. It really has very very very little to do with how 'secure' or insecure an operating system is. There is always a hole that can be found, linux, pc, unix, macOS, ps3, wii, or commodore64. Sometimes it requires inside jobs, sometimes it's more blatantly obvious.\r\n\r\nTo create a 'virus' that destroys the computer and data, sure it might be a bit harder on mac.

","c0hz1ss":"I stole this from [r\/gadgets](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gadgets\/comments\/ajx50\/nokia_n900_turned_into_ps3_controller\/) figured there would be more interest here","c0hz9b4":"I'm in the same boat.  I got my Xbox around the time of Gears of War and bought my PS3 when Metal Gear Solid 4 came out.  (bought my ps2 when MGS2 came out)  Normally I play my PS3 for exclusives and buy 90% of multiplats for the XBOX360.

I bought a charging tree off ebay for cheap.. much better purchase.\n\nI dont hunt around the ps3 store that much, but on the xbox marketplace, games are actually more expensive than in a real store for some reason","c0hzhvd":"yeah you need the cord (only one) but they're the standard usb hookup you would use on cameras and calculators. don't pay any more than 5$. here's the amazon link. \nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000067RVL\/ref=oss_T15_product\n\nyes, it works. even for 1 cent. i bought one and its just fine.\n\nIf you have a nearby router, I would buy a long ethernet cable to wire the ps3. it just makes life much easier.\n\nMake sure you have 2+ (gotta be dualshock) controllers.\n\nI HIGLHY recommend god of war collection. if you haven't played the series, you need to get on that. GOW collection is 40$ and has both 1 and 2 on a single blu ray disc. its the ps3 equivilant of halo as a system seller, except WAY better in a much different way. plus, it has the GOW3 demo (which is awesome btw). \n\ninfamous is also good (3rd person lightning villian badass satisfaction) if you got the coin.\n\nhit me up at chilldude0 and we can play LBP!\n \n","c0hzj6x":"You're most welcome.  You are going to love Uncharted 2, although you should probably play the first one.  It isn't necessary or anything, but it will help to establish some of the character relationships that aren't really explained in 2 (since they are assuming the buyer has played the first one)....and it's damn fun too.\n\nAlong with that, I'd recommend Batman: Arkham Asylum, it's an excellent game that features all of the voice actors from Batman the Animated Series (which means a GOOD Batman voice actor and Mark Hamil as the Joker).  I'd also recommend Metal Gear Solid: Guns of the Patriots if you like stealth action type games.  Having not played the preceding games in the series, you'll be missing the back story, but you could find somewhere online to read up on it before playing if you wanted to know what was going on (or download the free Metal Gear encyclopedia from the playstation store and read up on it there).\n\nIf you want more, just hit me up on reddit.  I'll be happy to share!","c0hzn9a":"GRADE A BULL PLOP! I had orange box on ps3 for about a month then traded it in. They gave me a ham sandwich and a half smoked cigarette for it.

When it came out too many people bitched about it not being enough like COD4 (especially control wise). It is a great game and if you give yourself enough time to get good at it online then you will have a great time playing it. \n\nUncharted 2 is a definite choice. \n\nIt's not too late to play MGS4 but do not expect to understand 99% of the storyline. I would suggest playing all previous MGS games (MGS1, MGS2, MGS3) though if you want to enjoy MGS4 as much as someone who has played those MGS games. There is one of the MGS PSP games that ties into it (only for a tiny bit of storyline) but it isn't as necessary as the console games. You can play MGS1 and MGS2 on pc but I do believe MGS3 was only ever released on PS2. \n\nRatchet and Clank Tools of Destruction is a very fun game and you may enjoy it. I did and I never played a R&amp;C game before that one. \n\nThere are still a lot of exclusives still to come for ps3 and a lot I did not mention here that are already released. The best thing you can do is look up ps3 exclusives, watch footage and read reviews. \n","c0i0oom":"I never had an issue. I had a buddy that played GranTurismo (again ps2) constantly on his projection tv and I think that hed take a break every 4-5 hours to prevent burn in. Personally I wouldnt worry about it too much but games that have a constant X on screen (think tac on GT) might do something so it might be a good idea to break here and there.","c0i0sbr":"Enjoy your new blu-ray player.\r\n\r\nI bought my ps3 as a BD player. The only games worth while to me will be GT5 and god of war 3. I've bought a bunch of others (GTA, metal gear) and haven't touched them. They sit unopened.","c0i0wf0":"I understand consoles are PC's made for gaming, with OSs made for gaming. What he was suggesting is that there be an OS made for gaming, that could be put on general computer hardware. Not Xbox hardware, not playstation hardware, but *general* computing hardware. To me his point was obvious, so I why bring up that consoles already exist?

This is only true as long as you speak about \"general-purpose\" computer where you have access to the memory, the harddisk, all of the cpu etc.\r\n\r\nOnce we speak of a machine which is *designed* for DRM, where the keys are burned in the CPU, where you don't have access to the memory, where you don't have acess to the executables, where the video signals are encrypted -- well there is copy protection possible. \r\n\r\nThe xbox360 is a good example for such a machine. Microsoft did some mistakes (you can copy the games, because the forgot the firmware of the DVDROM), but you still don't have access to the per CPU-keys, therefore not to the memory, and therefore not to the Player keys.\r\n\r\n(I heard rumours that there was found a flaw in the hypervisor which was fixed in the update in January. But anyway, the xbox360 is a totally different beast than an ordinary PC, where you just have to dump the memory)","c14pyb":"Still better than waiting weeks to get your \"Ring of Death\" fixed :P http:\/\/www.joystiq.com\/2007\/02\/01\/ring-of-death-a-xbox-360-story-part-1\/","c15h5b":"obviously, calvin needs to get his hands on an xbox 360...","c15owg":"people should stop fussing about which is better xbox&amp;PS3.Soon ps3 will show what they can do","c15owi":"people should stop fussing about which is better xbox&amp;PS3.Soon ps3 will show what they can do","c15yyu":"It may not be the best next gen but by the time xbox\/wii needs an upgrade PS3 will be at the top.

While open standards help, they are not the only way.  Not everything can be delivered over the internet or should be.  Open source can catch up to microsoft standards, but sooner or later msft patents will catch up.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is dying... I've heard this before with different nouns.  Don't count them out.. There are multiple industries that they dominate or will: pcs, cell phones, xbox\/games... MSFT plays a different game then google.  They will learn to play the google game on their own terms.  They only have to worry about being spread to thin...  and with the rate of technology progress this is not the major worry.\r\n\r\nMacs are still more expensive then PCs... It is like buying a BMW vs a Honda... Eventually it will be about buying a BMW vs. an Acura.  \r\n\r\nYes you can develop software without microsoft.

Just being honest.  Microsoft has the xbox line, some popular games that are out for PC, Windows operating system, Microsoft Office, .NET  They have Microsoft Research.

Sony already whupped them with the PS2, despite the xbox being better for developers. Nintendo's Wii appears to be the (short term) at least winner of the current round.\r\n\r\nAnd you should ditch the 'gaming is bigger than hollywood' canard. It's not true. If I remember the source of the statistic was that world-wide gaming sales top first-run box office takes. But when you factor in foreign markets, DVD, merchandising, sale to TV etc, Hollywood is way ahead. The line is blurred in any case (Alien vs. Predator was on TV two nights ago (in Germany)), and gaming is a big deal, but the bigger than hollywood is just hype.","c1ggi8":"Does this mean we will have group chat?

However, if spending a few seconds on grammar and spelling sound too much like selling out to The Man, then I encourage you to continue your righteous rebellion against written communication.

My 13 year old would probably be guided and taught by a bunch of militants because they were the only ones left to protect him and the hundreds (thousands?) of other children who have shattered or dead families.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't want that either and, fortunately, I don't have to make that choice.  Not so for many others; anywhere you see mobs of kids hurling rocks or toting rifles, you're seeing a symptom of an enormous problem because most of them would rather be playing xbox and football than cleaning Kalashnikovs or getting shot at.","c1qtxz":"My xbox wants it now","c1qxpk":"Odd, I was thinking about [something else](http:\/\/media.teamxbox.com\/dailyposts\/halo2bios\/01mc.jpg) entirely!","c1r2ky":"There are so many genres of game that simply can't exist on consoles with simple controllers.

It is natural that for those who vote with our dollars to choose the best value, the PS3. The movies cost the same, so ultimately the cheapest set-top or console system wins. Even then, the future only hold cheaper cost of entry to either technology (read walmart priced set-tops), and I say sony wins with cost of entry right now with the ps3. \r\n\r\nThat said, the numbers show that there are more blu-ray titles that hd-dvd. I think Sony knows about format wars, has endured thru them, and is letting time play on it side this time. Then again, they also own the rights to a giant catalog of grade-A movies that they restrict to their format.

Specifically, they banned the Console ID from Live.  Once it has been banned, you can never get on Live with that console again.  We're talking about the 360 here, mind you.  Since you reference cheaters (an impossibility on the 360 at this time) maybe you're thinking of the original Xbox?\r\n\r\nIf your console gets banned, its the console, not the gamertag or the Live account.  You can take your gamertag and Live account to another console and it will work just fine.  See xbox-scene.com if you want to read up on the whole saga.\r\n\r\nAlso, if your console wasn't banned, there is a new dvd firmware out that circumvents the checks implemented in the spring update and still allows people to play copied games on Live.  It can't restore a banned console to Live, but if your console didn't get banned you can use the new firmware to be sure it won't be in the future.","c1xdg2":"Maybe.   The PS3 is the most powerful console, and I suppose by 2010 they will have the price down to where everyone can afford it.   Nintendo will like have reached saturation by that time.   (my guess at much higher numbers than PS3 will ever reach)  In short it will be a good Christmas gift for kids in 2010, but they will already have the other consoles.   \r\n\r\nThe only question is how the xbox 360 will do.  (The WII isn't really in the same class as the other 2)  It is hot now too, and has good games that demand more power than the WII has.   IF Microsoft plays things right they can knock Sony out of the game - just keep the xbox 360 cheaper than the PS3, and keep good games there.   Since everyone has a xbox 360 all games will be for the xbox 360 (or at least for both), feeding the perception that there are no good games on the PS3.\r\n\r\nIf I were Microsoft I'd try to get with Nintendo to release a 'Frankenstein box' - a xbox 360 + Nintendo Wii in the same box, sharing a power supply (and little else) that sells for less than the PS3.    More for a publicity stunt that that I think people will buy one.

That's why I've been eagerly waiting until July 10 to get my copy of The Else, rather than buying it early from iTMS (and I've almost slipped several times... trust me ;))\r\n\r\nI also agree that Apple is one of those companies that will never die, no matter how you torture it. They have quite a bit going for them right now. But if the record labels successfully sabotage iTMS, do they have the power to carry a profitless division? Microsoft had it tough, after all.\r\n\r\nBut Microsoft has a distinct advantage with the xbox -- they get to control the entire system, from the hardware to the games you play on it. Apple has a lockdown on the iPod, but the music that is played on it is largely controlled by the big record groups.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that the big record industries don't try anything stupid to lock Apple out. My gut says that, if they did, Apple would (eventually) win a big antitrust lawsuit.

The original article in CRN Australia (a consumer rights publication) states:\r\n\r\n&gt; Microsoft has admitted that every one of the 11.6 million Xbox 360 consoles sold in the past 19 months suffers from a design flaw that could cause the device to fail.\r\n\r\nFastSilicon reports this verbatim.\r\n\r\nWhat Microsoft *actually* [said](http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-AE\/support\/petermooreletter.htm) was:\r\n\r\n&gt; We have been following this issue closely, and with on-going testing have identified several factors that can cause a general hardware failure indicated by three flashing red lights on the console. To address this issue, and as part of our ongoing work, we have already made certain improvements to the console.\r\n\r\nNow, you *could* read that as \"every Xbox 360 has a hardware issue\", but I think you'll have to agree that this does not necessarily follow by Peter Moore's words above.\r\n\r\nIn short:  Move along, there is no news here.  At least, nothing above and beyond Microsoft's open letter that was already publicised last week.  (If there was something new, the online gaming publications would all be headlining it.  They're not.)","c262kj":"Not true, my xbox died while it was on a shelf all by itself with no other devices anywhere near it and plenty of space.

I should note, I don't want to look too much like I'm defending Sony here - I haven't quite bought a ps3, and I've bought\/sold a Wii (didn't like); but we'll see.  \r\n- Blu-Ray. I see this as a sharp reason to subsidize our purchase of the ps3; but compared to other blu-ray players the ps3's price is great. You can read the amazon reviews of people who buy them just for that. I don't think anyone is getting ripped off here unless they are out buying HD-DVD movies.  This is the strongest reason for Sony to 'dump' the system, although they do share some of those royalties with subsidaries.  \r\n- HDTV's, I think that is an unfair assumption against Sony. While it's true driving HD sales helps them, it's not like they have a monopoly, and the average consumer is no longer brand-loyal. I have an HP HDTV, Sony PS2, Samsung everything else.  \r\n- Finally -Yes, and this is value for the customer, not just Sony. You can swap in\/out drives on the ps3. You aren't at the whim of Microsoft or trying to keep track of 20 different SD cards with your Wii.  \r\nMost importantly, I think your comment about 'I don't think it is something gamers should have to pay for'; with xbox you are paying to Unify and monopolize online gaming under the MS roof? You are further causing O\/S lock-in for their windows environment (Stream media, etc).  \r\nThe argument for\/against unified online is obviously a different topic, I don't mean to use it to argue the original point.","c28lkd":"for some reason i'm thinking \"xbox 360...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nedit: let me explain.\r\n\r\nlet's see... well, you have the sega cd which can be compared to the hd dvd add on. there's the \"sega master... whatchamajigger...\" let me just make a list :P\r\n\r\n- sega - xbox 360\r\n- sega cd - hd dvd add on\r\n- sega master... whatever - xbox 360 hdd (for backwards compatibility)\r\n- sega cartridge cleaner - we DEFINITELY need an integrated \"xbox dvd cleaner\" :P\r\n- game genie - action replay\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nedit... edit: once i started reading on, i found out that, apparently, you can \"stack\" games with a \"lock\" to provide \"expanded functionality?\" well, if that's true, then one could compare that to... *DUN DA DUN DA...* DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT (which isn't so much of a bad thing as long as you don't have to pay for it)! :P","c2by6x":"linkjacked...\r\nhttp:\/\/www.digg.com\/xbox_360\/Female_Gamers_Doing_it_Wrong_Pic =&gt; 3854 diggs","c2cjmf":"i like tiger woods on my xbox, but that's about it.","c2e35t":"Hysterical.  \r\n\r\nMy favorite one was from 3. \"Sing songs in the dark until 4 am.\"  \r\n\r\nMy first child as a baby was transfixed by this bouncing vibrating seat, and when he would get up in the middle of the night I would just put him in the seat, bounce it with my right foot, and fire up Capcom vs SNK2 on xbox live.

I use a stopwatch\/alarm program daily. I can use my phone as a USB keydrive (no drivers required). I can run Skype and MSN\/Yahoo\/AOL from one program.   I can connect over GPRS and share the connection over Wifi. I've got some really fun games on it.

The Wii is not trying to be a complete media center replacement like the xbox, but it is doing a few things the xbox isn't.  Other things that come to mind are the built in wireless support, and of course, the much touted controller system which doesn't work too badly considering it's the first time someone has done it in a console.\r\n\r\nWhy must it always be \"if you like x, you must be a fanboy and totally hate y\"?","c2kg3q":"&gt; sales will pick up when Halo 3 is released soon.\r\n\r\nWasn't the \"Wait for *whatever game comes out next*\" supposed to be used only for the PS3?\r\n\r\nYou gonna get sued!\r\n\r\nAs a side note, xbox will not significantly pick up out of the US, and the US alone is far from enough to rank really high in a given console generation.","c2lr4y":"Obviously I am informed.

A lot of people will remember it because it is out of the ordinary, and since they associate the name with the product, and the product is good, then the name becomes good based on the merit of the product.  \r\n\r\nIt's demonstrable that even if people don't like the name of something, they will use it if they remember it, and if they associate it with merit. Weirder names are more memorable.  Merit (or value) works for itself.  I prefer this method of product design to the alternative: use a cool sounding name, make your product look cool, and it doesn't matter how much value it has because people will buy it anyway.  That's the way Wii vs. xbox 360 works.  Anyway, here's the formula in word form.  Consider a capitalized word a variable, and Bad or Good as one variable with a spectrum with Bad on the negative end, and Neutral in the middle.\r\n\r\nWhere Name is Memorable (not Bad or Good, just Memorable), if Name is associated with Merit (negative or positive), then Name becomes correspondingly negative or positive with regard to the Bad or Good spectrum.  \r\n\r\nThe reason these obscure and strange names make for good product names is that they establish a product to be more unique in the mind of a consumer than it actually is.  This will cause a customer to remember it.  If the product is demonstrably unique in a good way, then the name will become associated with that concept.  They remember it, they remember it is quality, and they therefore desire it.\r\n\r\nMarketing on a high level becomes very similar to psychology, because it seems like mumbo jumbo, but it's not: this is how people think about consumerism, and if you can effectively manipulate it you can become very, very rich.

If we had more than 1 xbox, im sure they would of canceled us.\r\n\r\nSo yes, Xbox users in multi user homes need to worry....","c2qf28":"This looks neat , a similar architecture that is used in the xbox360. I don't know if chip yields also presented a problem but cooling did.","c2rzcp":"\"i'll take the $60\/mo 10mbps down\/1mbps up broadband service from comcast (plus the $15\/mo to lose the bandwidth cap on certain applications such as p2p (plus the $5\/mo to drop the 200gb\/mo limit)... and i guess i'll take the $30\/mo usenet service with encryption (hehe).\"\r\n\r\n**most of the net is ALREADY *NOT* neutral (it's the web we gotta worry about)!**\r\n\r\n\"i guess i'll take the third-tier service.\r\n\r\ndoes that include the new york times?

That is the very reason that many continue to play.\r\n\r\nI play the game twice a week for raid purposes, but other than that, I play actual social videogames; ie. I actually go to a place where there is a tv(or computer monitor) and sit down with others people to play xbox360, wii, or ddr.  A lot of those games have no point to them either, and I love those games for the shear challenge of putting it in the hardest difficulty and beating it.\r\n\r\nAnd time shift 2 sucks ass, thats the game he's from.","c2sw94":"This seems pretty similar to the e-fuses in the xbox

can permanently alter your mind, changing personality.\r\n\r\nThat's the whole point of doing psychedelics. If you aren't looking for a cathartic, insightful, ego-shattering trip out of the experience, then why do psychedelics at all?\r\n\r\nTry this- the next time you get a bag of shrooms, instead of sharing them with 5 of your friends and playing xbox all night, man up and eat the whole bag yourself. Then you'll know what the \"psychedelic experience\" is about; anything else is just pointless *cocktail tripping*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","c2vm4d":"I don't know about the legal ramifications of a split like this, but it wouldn't surprise me if Bungie wants out.  Microsoft is notoriously fickle about supporting its internal studios and has been behind some truly boneheaded decisions.  Microsoft has too much on its plate to really concentrate on gaming and do it right.  The only reason the xbox 360 isn't a complete bomb is because Sony decided to shoot itself in the foot.","c2w99f":"I'm by no means a full blown introvert, but I can never understand why after work people want to go out and drink and small talk. Nothing seems less interesting at the time, when I would much rather go home, chill, play some xbox, THEN go out boozing. I need that little alone time, but I find lots of people I know don't.","c2wikk":"Which gets directly back to the parents. Don't let the kids play until their work is done. If it's done poorly, don't let them play until the bring their grades up. It's a simple formula for success, but wait, it requires effort on the parents' part! Silly me, it's much easier to let them play xbox all night long.","c2wmmo":"Ah, that's the simplistic way of seeing homework - preparation for tests. The successful have taught themselves to see homework differently, as preparation for the hard work it takes to succeed. THAT is the method to train children for self-fulfillment. Don't dwell on the low-order skills gained from homework, dwell on the discipline and the diligence it takes to put up with low-order work in order to achieve some higher goal. Some call it \"dull, worker-drone\" work, successful people call it preparation.\r\n\r\nWalking and skateboard stunts are easy exertions - they payback is immediate. It's (mentally\/emotionally) much harder to sacrifice two hours on xbox now for, say, a Nobel Prize in Physics forty years away.\r\n\r\nNow unfortunately the jury is still out on how to bring out children. For every study that supports love and understanding as training for success\/self-fulfillment, there's another that supports discipline and rigor. I suppose we'll never know what works best. Somehow, I think it's best not to know.","c2wtax":"Tillman didn \"join the hunt.\"  The sad thing is that Pat Tillman seems to get all this great press about how magical he was for giving up his career of being another reggie bush.  Lots of people gave up careers to join the military.  He gave up playing a fucking game.  Thats no different than a high school graduate who decides to join up instead of playing xbox all day.\r\n\r\nAnd the dixie chicks coming out against the war really had a huge impact.\r\n\r\nNo one in power gives a shit about what anyone else says.  You can be critcal all day long.  Bush got what he wanted and will keep getting it till the day he leaves office because our country is filled with spineless democrats and corrupt republicans.  And idiots who waste their time posting about how ron paul made in a quarter what hillary makes in a week.","c2wx1k":"I love XBMC. It would cost way more than the $150 price of an xbox to get the same functionality in a computer.","c2wx84":"I just bought a HDTV component cable for mine.  I can't believe that the 2001 xbox supported 720p.  I bet they *could* get it to run halo 3 too.","c2wy8q":"I think i read something about people replacing the cpu with something more powerful in order to get it to play 1080i videos.\r\n\r\nTalking about openness though, the xbox is probably the most open video game console ever once you get past that tiny issue of modding it.","c2x2ph":"This is a cool site that tells you how to get an xbox 360 for free.","c2xp0n":"I shot a grenade with a rocket to commit suicide once... in fact its the last on my file share page [download-it-to-your-xbox](http:\/\/www.bungie.net\/stats\/Halo3\/FileShare.aspx?gamertag=bafflesaurusrex)","c2xug0":"This is a great idea. I have a few friends who are teachers ranging from elementary school to high school, and they all say that parents these days just do not understand that they are their childrens' first teachers, and that they need to play a crucial role in their educations. Parents have literally asked them for advice on raising their kids and how to make them do their homework. \r\n\r\n\"Well, he doesn't want to do it, how can I make sure he does.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he have a playstation or an xbox or something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah...\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't let him use it until he finishes his work.\"\r\n\r\nIt's not that hard. \r\n\r\nI really don't think its bad teaching as much as bad parenting that is the biggest problem with our education system today.","c2yueg":"Isn't that the nature of humanity? To make up for the shortcomings of our predecessors?\r\n\r\nThe boomers fixed some of mess of the greatest and the lost, the lost and the greatest fixed some of the mess of the interbellum. It goes all the way back to Lucy or Adam. The memorable generations pick up the ball that gets dropped. The loser generations watch it roll away. But most lousy ones are those that watch it drop yet refuse to pick it up because \"it wasn't me who dropped it\".\r\n\r\nDoes it matter who is to blame? Perhaps. But the boomer's time is done. No one should expect those aging wastrels who never really grew up to do much any more for much longer.\r\n\r\nWhat should matter is how we are remembered. We must not allow ourselves to be remembered as the generation who, when the boomers lost a step, couldn't pick up their slack and couldn't take the controls from their possessive, domineering hands.\r\n\r\n(Because that's how history books read, especially ancient history. They praise the success of a great individual\/generation but then blame the subsequent decline\/collapse on the generation that witnessed it. Whether the preceding generation could have prevented it or not is usually ignored.)\r\n\r\nLet's take responsibility for our times, regardless of who caused the shit. Now maybe the xbox, WoW, reddit and the blogosphere is how we do it. Unfortunately, it's not working.","c2yztd":"[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/green_eyes_ringtone.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/born_too_slow_ringtone_mp3.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/wfc_nokia_n_series_3_mp_phone__kinda_like_the_new_nokia_n73.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/motorola_razor_v7.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/ontario_do_not_call_list.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/samsung_p5sx_review.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/nokia_6682_prices.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/motorola_l_6.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/using_cell_phone_while_driving.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/ebay_motorola_black_razor.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/nokia_6280_theme.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/funny_ringtones_for_nokia.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/problem_xbox_360_call_of_duty_freezes.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/8390_ringtones.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/verizon_nim.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/mp3_ringtones_downloads.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/free_t_mobile_ringtones_for_cell_phones.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/free_ringtone_converter_download.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/cell_phone_at_the_gas_pump.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/what_do_we_call_clean_in_japenese.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/ringtone_de_t__233_l__233_phone_cellulaire_du_sud.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/verizon_email_directors.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/nokia_6102_face_plates.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/battery_for_motorola_mpx220.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/lib__233_rer_nokia_trac_t__227___169_l__227___169_phone_ringtones.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/nokia_6280_free_applications.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/holster_for_motorola_e_815.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/discount_cell_phone_plans_arkansas.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/free_rap_ringtones_through_text_messages.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/nicole_mullen__when_i_call_on_jesus.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/samsung_ml1450_driver_update.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/tree_glencourse_inventory_update_verizon_bill_cluster.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/australia_motorola_razr_v3x.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/animr_ringtones.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/motorola_elic_sample_current__dielectric_status.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/c56_ringtone.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/stephen_thomas_on_roll_call_voting_behavior_of_u_s__senate.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/cingular_reviews_new_jersey.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/free_polyphonic_crazy_frog_ring_tones.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/www_verizonwireless_com_discount.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/ringtones_for_nokia_3200.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/verizon_amiga_phones.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/mobile_ringtones_mobile_ringtones_jamsteraustralia_automarketsol_com_au.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/camcorder_samsung_d453.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/samsung_sd_616t_16x_dvd_rom_rev__a01_drivers.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/los_angeles_call_girl.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/free_nokia_ringtones_for_tracfone.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/listen_techno_music_sites_ringtones_circuitcity_wikipedia_mp3_bbc.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/motorola_cdma_ringtones.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/les_affaires_de_samsung_t__233_l__227___169_phonent_le_syst__227___168_me.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/verizon_razr_deals.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/ringtones_for_nokia_6230.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/cingular_wireless_plans.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/free_funny_ringtones.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/t__233_l__233_phone_de_nokia_de_cellules_de_1260_accessoires.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/motorola_h500_user_guide.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/coldplay_clock_ringtone.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/nokia_n90__australia.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/no_doubt_ringtones.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/blank_sim_card_for_motorola_l6.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/samsung_cdrom_installation_drives.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/samsung_sch_n415_configurar_wap_free.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/motorola_razr_for_verizon_wireless_without_plan.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/interpretaion_of_the_call_of_the_wild.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/x_ringtone.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/24_apr__mobile_motorola_devices_products.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/download_ringtones_with_words_to_my_cell_phone.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/soap_web_service_call_c.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/i_need_to_check_my_email_on_verizon_net.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/manual_for_a_lg_vx6000_phone.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/affaires_cingular_libres_de_ringtone.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/teacher_dancing_on_cell_phone.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/free_penn_st_ringtones.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/ecommerce_cell_phone_cases.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/usb_razr_hack_photo_ringtone.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/cell_phones_with_blue_tooth.html)\r\n[.](http:\/\/lubcza.cn\/cingular_lgc2000_wir

(that tells you something) and alot of the ads are like this:\n\n\"I am selling this becuase we just had a new baby and we need the money.\" They buy the big screen like 2 months or so before the baby is born then they sell it. Alot of people don't have thier priorities straight. They have the money to get a big screen tv and xbox 360 and 50 games but do not have enough money for birth control and condoms. or they think that birth control is from the devil.

So consoles, often costing about as much as a good video card alone, tend to be a much more accessible option to the mainstream, especially since you only have to swap them out once every 5 years or so.\n\nI'd hesitate to use the term *jealous*, though. (old-school) Gamers in general always been kind of an elitist group, and the majority of PC gamers would probably *hate* it if everyone from xbox live started playing with them (This is one reason I don't think multi-platform multiplay will ever really hit it off).   \nIt's just that when a game like Halo 2 gets a higher rating than a game like Half-Life 2 from the same publication, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Regardless of the console sensation that Halo might be, HL2 was an unequivocally superior experience for those to whom it was available.\n\n*My* problem, from a state-of-the-industry standpoint, is now every game developer is trying to ride the Halo 2 success train and putting out all these crap FPS titles for consoles. I'd rather they stuck to what they're good at.\n\n I'm looking forward to assassin's creed and mass effect more than most other things at the moment.","c029fwj":"I got a brand new computer with a core 2 duo and a geforce 8600gt for $600 last month.  If I wanted to upgrade in three years, I'd spend about $100-$120 on the latest videocard sitting at that price point (that's how much an 8600gt costs right now).  My PC will run Crysis, etc.  The $1500-$2000 PC is no longer necessary for gaming whatsoever: it died not too long after Doom 3.  \n\nConsoles aren't taking over the market!  They're _already_ the majority of the market.  The reason for this isn't price. At this point, PCs are actually cheaper and more reliable than current gen consoles like the xbox 360, and parts distributors like evga offer lifetime full-coverage warranties.\n\nSo why are consoles on top?  User interface.  It's a hell of a lot easier to get into a game with a console.  That's it.

Changing the led is easy, but until I get one, no idea if I can put my own black plastic knob on it.\n\nAs for front panel buttons, I was thinking about cannibalizing a usb keyboard, using it's control board and wiring up some proper switches to it.

First of all, exhaust your financial aid options before getting a loan. If you do get a loan, don't spend the money on frivolous things (like going out drinking, or buying that new fancy cell phone\/xbox). It seems like a good idea, but when you are paying that loan back for the next 10-20 years, you'll regret it. Student loans can be good for somethings, like buying a cheap car, where you would otherwise be paying a lot higher interest rate.\n\n3.

As long as every person in a society is willing to get up in the morning and do useful work for a decent amount of time per day (and at least some minimum fraction of societies work is put towards food, shelter and health) then that society is wealthy - regardless of whether people come home after work to enjoy an hour on the xbox or an hour playing cards. Gold, precious gems - any kind of physical standard is not only meaningless it puts a false cap on the amount of work that people will be willing to do (not enough gold, not enough labor).\n\nPaying people an abstract quantity (i.e. money as we know it today) for work they have done is better. It attributes a non-limited value to the work that is done (whether you are paying for the labor directly or paying for the fruits of the labor). Not being limited it encourages all to work as much as they wish being relatively certain they will be paid for it.\n\nMoney as debt is actually just an extension of this. It is saying that you are being paid in advance for work that you pledge to do. When someone takes out a mortgage they are saying \"I promise to work for X amount of years to pay for the labor that went in to making this house\". Since the vast majority of people WILL continue to work and WILL manage to pay off their mortgage (the seller deceit behind the current and temporary sub-prime mortgage crisis aside) the system works - payment is made for labor done albeit in advance. It is even better than payment for labor already done because this encourages people to work even more. There is no doubt that credit cards - which gives people the chance to enjoy things in life they would not normally have been able to (with the understanding that they will have to do a minimum amount of work to pay for it) - has greatly contributed to the economy. The willingness to lend and borrow is the best measure of a growing economy and money as debt basically represents that.\n\nSo rather than convince me that money as debt is a bad thing, it's convinced me that its the best thing for modern economy.","c02iv2b":"Can't.

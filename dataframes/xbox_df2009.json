However, I would like to respond to its criticisms. I've divided it into sections mirroring the article.\n\nCreation of the Earth: \n\nThe word day in Arabic is Yaum, which can also mean a period of time. When it said that God created the heavens and the Earth in 6 Days, the word days does not specifically mean 6 days constituting 24 hours, 1000 years or 50000 years, but 6 unspecified periods of time. The defined length of a day in the Quran some have seen to be contradicting one another, but if one uses the other definition of the arabic word Day which means a period of time, I believe that it will be clear that there is no contradiction. I found this [link](http:\/\/www.islam-australia.iinet.net.au\/faqs\/the_quran.html#A%20particular%20verse%20of%20the%20Qur%E2%80%99an%20says%20that%20one%20day%20in%20the%20sight%20of%20Allah%20is%20equal%20to%201000%20years.%20In%20another%20verse%20of%20the%20Qur%E2%80%99an%20it%20says%20that%20one%20day%20is%20equal%20to%2050,000%20years.%20Isn%E2%80%99t%20the%20Qur%E2%80%99an%20contradicting%20itself) which pretty much explains what I've said\n\nEmbryology:\n\nIn this section, there were two verses of the Quran mentioned. The first one's apparent inaccuracy is that living tissue forms first followed by bone, whereas the verse says it happens the other way around. But if you notice the verse, the order of creation was:\n\nlump-&gt;bone-&gt;flesh\n\nThat lump is flesh. In my copy of the English interpretation of the Quran, it in fact says \"little lump of flesh\". If we however you don't want to concede this point, the next step would be to start learning Arabic as the Quran can not be translated into English without losing something in translation.\n\nAs for the other verse, which states man is created from fluid gushing from between the backbone and ribs. I'm having a bit of trouble with it. Biology was never my strong suit so I'll try to get back to you later.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nI found this [link](http:\/\/www.islamicvoice.com\/january.97\/scie.htm#CREA) speaking of the verse concerning the backbone and ribs. I found some relevant pages to support the earlier link since the author didn't provide references. [1](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Testicle#Embryonic) [2](http:\/\/www.netterimages.com\/images\/vpv\/000\/000\/005\/5106-0550x0475.jpg) [3](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lymphatic_system)\n\nScientific Absurdities in the Qur'an and Hadith: \n\nThis whole section of your linked article seems to be forgetting one thing, that we're talking about God here. God, by definition, can do anything. Forget about the 'absurdities' presented, in the Day of Judgment, it is said that one's own body parts would be a witness against him. \n\nGod, by definition, is the creator, and just like the creator of a xbox game, he can make tree talk without giving it all the physical body parts that we require to talk.\n\nMay I ask though did the Greeks also predict that moon did not have its own light? The article you linked attempted to speaks of **some** but not **all** scientific facts in the Quran. If you are satisfied with my responses above (excluding the one which I could not address currently) how about you answer my original question to you about the probability of all the facts in the Quran was man made?\n\nIf however you don't find my responses satisfactory, lets continue the conversation. It's been a while since I had an intelligent debate on reddit and I hope your enjoying this conversation as much as I am. :)","820t":"The zune 30gb is arguably a superior product to all but the top of the ipod lineup. the failings of Microsoft's attempts at marketing such a product do not require the product itself to be a failure. If nothing else Microsoft has failed only at convincing early adopters to jump ship from Apple.\n\n\nZune's current Zunepass \"unlimited plus ten\" is by far the best legal way for the masses to experience music. For 15 bucks a month I can download unlimited rental tracks AND get 10 purchased tracks which are mine to keep AND a single zunepass is good for 3 zune media players and 3 computers.\n\nI've owned 4 different generations of Apple ipods including the ipod touch and I still think that zune is more a marketing failure than a conceptual or executional failure. (ipod:zune::ps2:xbox), Inclusion of zune software in the forthcoming version of windows mobile (6.5 &amp; 7 both due in 2009) should make (ipod:zune::ps3:xbox360). Only the market-droids can make that happen though.","8re4":"&gt; unless you are an idiot who crashes their computer or can't figure out how to solve their own problems\n\nWhat, you mean the vast majority computer users?\n\n&gt; fancy consols that don't play games. Like a PS3 that you use for music, movies and photoshop\n\nAgain, like most users?\n\nI think I can guess your occupation from your screen name and infer your level of computer expertise.  Could I remind you that most people just want to use their computers (regardless of platform) for music, movies, and internet?  When the average computer user wants to play games, they probably go over to PS3 or xbox, you know, that other machine they bought that is specifically for that purpose.  Apple isn't advertising to hardcore users, you know.\n\nAlso, \"innovation by the fan base\" (outside of the great example of game mods) is a piss poor defense of software with poor functionality.","8t1u":"I have an xbox too.  I found Halo very difficult on Legendary mode on the xbox.  When I got the PC version I couldn't believe how incredibly easy it was.  The simple fact is that mouse is fully analog and maps 1:1 with your hand movements, whereas 'analog' controllers are a poor approximation.","8vq5":"I'm glad you chose \"Good\" instead of \"Better\". The tendency to declare one option or the other as the best way to game is simplistic and honestly quite stupid. \n\nNobody games the same, as best illustrated by the fact that one of the items on your list is a reasons I prefer PC gaming.\n\nConsoles can't touch PCs when it comes to RTS or MMO games (or FPS games, IMO), but PCs are far too complex and expensive to keep running for your average casual gamer, especially those that want a system that'll just work. The increasing number of games that come out for consoles long before PC, and the problems with PC compatibility are valid points as well.\n\nThis comparison is likely going to lose me any points I've won so far, but PC vs. Console is a lot like the comparison between PC and Mac.\n\nAnyway, I'll never be anything other than a PC gamer (and a Windows user), but that doesn't mean that I'm having the most fun it's possible to have, or that I'll look down on console gamers. Unless they claim xbox TF2 anywhere approaches PC TF2.","8vw3":"&gt;   Games have no installation time.\n\nNot true, ever used a PS3?  The installation of a game means it loads much faster than trying to run off of optical media.\n\n&gt;   You know that game is going to work the same way on your console as it does on anyone else's console.\n\nNot true - for example, some PS3's can play PS2 games well, some can kind of play them, others can't play jack\n\n&gt;   Consoles cost substantially less.\n\nWrong. http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gaming\/comments\/7l04h\/graphics_of_pc_vs_xbox_vs_ps3_side_by_side\/2uk5\n\n$246 for a PC that destroys Xbox and PS3 in graphical ability.  Also - most people *need* a computer for work\/entertainment anyways, so why not spend a few extra dollars for a video card and make it a gaming station.\n\n&gt;   Consoles require far less maintenance than a PC\n\nRROD?  I don't know what \"maintenance\" you're talking about, but at least if something goes wrong with a PC, I can fix it myself rather than paying the manufacturer ungodly amounts and waiting a month.\n\n&gt;   Keeping a PC in a state of being able to run new games requires frequent updates, hardware changes and performance tweaks.\n\nAgain, incorrect - you can build an entirely new computer for $246 dollars.  If your graphics card is outdated (main thing that makes it not possible to play), you can buy a new one for $75 bucks.\n\n&gt;   Consoles are much easier to play with friends.\n\nIn the same room?  LAN party (easy and way more fun than a shitty console match).  Internet?  Non-MMORPG games on the PC usually have *free* online play with tons of customization where-as you have to pay to play on Xbox Live and the service is lame. \n\n&gt;   Consoles are probably connected to the biggest monitor in the house.\n\nExcept the resolution sucks.  Also, you can hook a computer up to a TV with a $5 cable.\n\n&gt;   Consoles generally have a way to attach a keyboard to them. PS3 even accepts mice I think.\n\nWrong.  You can use a mouse and keyboard for **1** console (the PS3), but it is not supported for most games.\n\n&gt;   Updating games works much better on consoles than PCs where game companies are still reinventing the game updater with every game. (Exception is Steam)\n\nWhat?  Before the latest series of consoles, if a game had a bug, too bad.  Now they can release updates automatically but so do a lot of PC games.\n\n&gt;  Console graphics just aren't that different from PC graphics.\n\nYes they are - not just the texture quality of the graphics, but the resolution (limited by the TV on a console) makes a huge difference.  Add to that, the processing power of video cards versus consoles makes ambient lighting, shadows, etc way better on a PC.\n\n&gt;  Consoles are where the money is at for the big game pulishers right now so a lot of games are coming out for consoles.\n\nConsoles have an abundant quantity of games (shitty ones)... and yet the *quality* of games on the PC is usually much better.  Also, there are almost no RTS, Simulation, etc games on consoles.\n\n&gt;  A lot easier for a game company to QA a console than to QA PC games because of the infinite number of configurations a PC can have for hardware and software.\n\nSo?  That's like saying the space shuttle sucks because there are so many different parts and walking is a way better method of travel.\n\nMost games are built on existing libraries and engines (DirectX, etc), so Q&amp;A isn't a crapshoot.\n\n&gt;  Consoles can receive OS updates the same way PCs can.\n\nWrong.  Consoles can receive standardized OS updates from the manufacturer.  PCs can update their OS however they want (they can even switch OSes).\n\n&gt;  People can buy used console games.\n\nPeople can buy used PC games.  Also, most PC games are $10 cheaper than their console counterparts because they don't have to pay licensing fees to the console maker (good for small-time publishers).\n\n&gt;  Gamefly is for console games.\n\nPiratebay is for PCs.  Try before you buy, delivered digitally right to your game station!","8w0e":"Except you can build a new computer for $246 dollars.  That beats out the console prices (except the Wii) and will perform much better.  Most people need PCs for productivity anyways, why not spend a few extra bucks and get ones that can play games.\n\nThe great thing about PCs is that they are very customizable - mouse+keyboard bad for flight sims and driving games?... luckily there are a slew of racing wheels, joysticks, etc at competitive prices from third party manufacturers (where-as on consoles you're locked to what the console maker allows for inputs and the companies that make products all have to pay licensing fees).\n\nhttp:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gaming\/comments\/7l04h\/graphics_of_pc_vs_xbox_vs_ps3_side_by_side\/2uk5","8ygi":"&gt;While I agree with most of his points, the author seemed to pad the list a bit. For example, the idea that PCs can beat out 1080P is kinda ridiculous. Most monitors under 24\" cannot even handle 1080P, and many video cards cannot run full speed at that resolution. \n\n1680x1020 with 16x Anti Aliasing is WAAAAAAY better than 1920x1080 with no anti aliasing. And you can get a 8800 GT for $120 and that can run almost any game at 1680x1050\n\n&gt;His points about mouse+keyboard are valid, but they do not work so well in driving and flight simulation games.\n\nI have an xbox controller, also you can use almost any wheel or joystick for those.","8yq5":"Not a recap of the article -- BUT a good point.\n\nI'd buy an xbox if they'd just require mouse+keyboard support for their games.","982f":"I used to have a tv that would show the s-video and analog at the same time overlapping each other.

Obviously there's no issue of \"slower\" 360s.","a8r2":"More social is an understatement.\n\nAround Christmas I brought the old xbox over to my parents house...\n\nRock Band really *REALLY* outperforms GHWT in multiplayer. My wife and sister in law spent a good 45 minutes creating such characters as \"Cunty\" and \"S'latte\" and were incredibly pissed off by the character creation in GHWT.\n\nThe overall band gameplay is much better in rock band (individual star power that gets applied as a band multiplier for example).\n\nThe one thing that GHWT got right was auto bass pedal which allowed all the nubs to play without breaking their ankles :)\n\nIf you are playing by yourself, then GHWT is just fine, but as soon as you throw other people into the mix, it gets left behind...\n\n(Also, the Xbox live play for GHWT is head scratchingly stupid... WTF, I can't play in a partial band? And I can't see stats after we finish a song? Seriously?)","a93h":"The Playstation 2 is the most played console at the moment, but when speaking for next gen, the xbox 360 trumps the competition.","akfn":"&gt; It is well documented that the average age of gamers in Australia is now around 30 years old.\n\nI wish this were true everywhere, playing against the general public on xbox live might be much more fun.","akn3":"\n\n    It is well documented that the average age of gamers in Australia is now around 30 years old.\n\nI wish this were true everywhere, playing against the general public on xbox live might be much more fun.","asai":"Two thoughts:\n\n1) If you add up the percentages, it's 100.1%.

Apparently some professor in Greece had an algorithms assignment using Proximity as well (his student emailed me asking for help). \n\nThere's also a [book](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Advanced-ActionScript-3-Design-Patterns\/dp\/0321426568\/) that has two chapters on how to make a basic version of Proximity, though I was never mentioned by name.\n\nWon 2nd place in a flash game development contest at AddictingGames.com.\n\nI was interviewed for an article in the Daily Herald about NaNoWriMo a few years ago.\n\nI've been in several meetings with and been given advice from some pretty influential people in the games industry. It was a surprise to see Tim Schaefer's pictures pop up in my Facebook News Feed a few weeks ago. \n\nSo... yeah, that's quite a bit, it's possible my fifteen minutes is just about to run out. It's also not as gratifying as it might sound, in fact I've never ever had anywhere near as much stress in my life and I'm still struggling with how to handle it all.

I'm not advocating the banishment of gaming consoles...rather, just a reminder that there is a place called \"outside\".\n\nMy problem with your suggestion isn't that I'm indifferent, it's that it represents wasted effort. The point you bring up is valid, if dramatically overrepresented in the media. I'm assuming the end-goal of your proposal is to increase the activity level of kids.

I got my Ranger to 60 (in the first expansion) and I had many fun adventures in the plane of fear and other fun places.  I stopped playing on the second expansion.  I know some people that still play it.  I think it has 16 expansions now.\r\n#2 Diablo 2: The game does not track time played, but I have been playing it on and off for seven years.  If I had to guess I have probably played this about as much as Everquest.  Sadly, I still have not found every item in the game.  WRU GRANDFATHER SWORD??  This game with a 100% secure environment, an auction house, and a huge bank would be pure heroin.  A list of achievements would be cool too.\r\n\r\nHonorable mentions:\r\n\r\nTop fighters:  \r\n- Virtua Fighter 2 &amp; 3 I have a pretty good Lau. ;)  \r\n- Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo I have a pretty good Zangief. ;D  Currently ranked 900 on xbox live.  I'm not the best at this game, but I can hang.  One time I beat a 59th ranked M. Bison player. ^.^\r\n\r\nTop sports:  \r\n- Madden '05 I was once ranked in the PS2 top 100 and I never did the stupid quit bug.  I took my losses like a man 100% of the time.  I have been playing the series since the game didn't have a year at the end of the title. Good old John Madden Football on the Sega Genesis.  \r\n- Tecmo Super Bowl \r\n\r\nStrategy:  \r\n- Starcraft: I was once #1 on the ladder for one day and then I stopped playing because I'm a huge pussy and the stress got to me.  I got there by playing island maps.  I started the first day 35-0.  I lost a few matches on my second day.  \r\n- Civilization series: I have been playing Civ Revolution lately.  I am a latecomer to the series, but I can see how this game can easily eat up hours and days of your life.  I almost have all of the achievements now.  This is about as good as turn-based strategy games are going to get.\r\n\r\nShooter:\r\n- Counterstrike  \r\n- Quake 2 CTF the bane of my sophomore year of college.  I still think this game is more interesting than most modern FPS games.  Auto-doc, power amp, rapid fire, defense tech, grappling hooks, quad damage, cell shields, and armor.  It had a lot of elements going on, while most modern games seem to have gotten simpler.  Left 4 Dead is a good example of this.\r\n\r\nRhythm:  \r\n- Rock Band 1 &amp; 2: Harmonix still makes the best music games.  I've ranked in the top 300 on drums and in the top 500 on vocals.  Many wasted hours on this one.  I'm glad it doesn't keep track of it.  ;)  I currently have 1000\/1000 achievement points on RB2 and 930\/1000 for RB1.\r\n\r\nRPGs:\r\n- World of Warcraft: I got a priest to 70 and I logged about 40 days, or 960 hours, total.  Great game, but highly derivative of Everquest so it did not have the same narcotic-drenched impact on me.  The PvP could use more variety.  \r\n- Phantasy Star Online: I played this game a lot because I love cooperative action RPG's.  It's a simpler, less interesting, slower version of what a 3D Diablo would be like.  I also played its successor Phantasy Star Universe to the maximum level which was faster and more interesting, yet still underwhelming.  \r\n- Final Fantasy Online: A mere 15 days, or 360 hours, logged.  A brief stint lol.  \r\n- Hellgate London: I played this with a friend for a while.  It was a fun Diablo-type of game, but it quickly gets old once you reach the maximum level.  It probably has the most annoying inventory system of all time.  I think I had about 20 days on this one.  I got my evoker up to 60 or whatever the hell the maximum level was.  \r\n- Phantasy Star 2: I have no idea why I beat this game like eight times--but I did.  It's so charmingly old school.","c0716b1":"I think Jayden Smith being casted to play the \"kid\" is more deserving of a WTF.

They're both good at what they do but don't try to make one into the other, both companies have established \"personalities\".\n\nTo be honest, I must agree that news of changes tend to make me happy in the short term, but then I worry about their impact on the game.\n\nI don't think the RTS formula can really be refined when it comes to ultra-competitive RTS.  Starcraft is pretty much the top in this regard.  In fact, the antiquated UI is one of the major things that make it such a competitive game, which means Starcraft 2 will certainly take less skill to play.\n\nProgress can be made to reach the more casual crowds, but even then, if you don't have a solid modding community and good networking, it won't work.  Which is why I don't think Relic is doing the right thing.  They should be working on Relic Online and making sure that it's easy to make maps and use triggers to create custom games.  Instead, they've announced they will never release mod tools because the engine can hardly support it.  That's pretty bad.\n\nThe RTS genre is by definition for hardcore gamers.  There is simply so much stuff going on, so many things to know, so many choices to make in precious few seconds that more casual gamers can be easily scared unless you give them a very dumbed down game (which will bore them instead).  I think Blizzard has the right idea when it comes to casuals. It's not the game you have to change: you have to give players the power to change the experience.  Dota is clearly the modern day counterstrike: a Warcraft 3 map that has become as popular as the game it comes from.  Two games are coming out in the following months that could best be described as \"Dota-like\".  A new genre has been created.  That's because battle.net, even in its current form, is the best network on the market.  It allows you to effortlessly download custom maps by simply joining a game.  It allows you to form clans and meet with friends with ease.  Battle.net 2.0 (which will launch alongside Starcraft 2) will feature even better clan support and will have many more features to encourage the creation of communities of players.  For example, players will now have one \"Blizzard account\" that works with all their games, and you will be able to get achievements in games (just like on the xbox 360).  This kind of thing easily gets the casual market (and is even attractive to hardcore gamers!).\n\nOn top of that, they're spending a significant amount of men hours ensuring that the game is easily moddable and that the map tools will be easy to use.  In fact, they're even including unused assets (like the models for classic Starcraft units) and unused gameplay mechanics (like heroes leveling up) to ensure that the map makers won't be missing anything.\n\nYou can say what you want about Blizzard's refusal to change the core gameplay of Starcraft 2, but you have to give them something: they're very willing to innovate when it comes to everything that surrounds the core experience.  Battle.net 2.0 and the new map tools are reasons alone to be hyped for Starcraft 2.  Why ask Blizzard to make risky changes to the game when you can do the same easily with map tools?  Hell, you can create entire new ways to play the game with the map tools.  And it's all available to other players within 30 seconds of them joining your game.  I bought Warcraft 3, but I must admit I've never played more than about 70 games online.  But I've played the custom maps for countless hours, and I think Starcraft 2 won't disappoint me in this regard.  It will give me a choice: it will offer me the good old traditional gameplay I like, and then tons of new experiences when I feel like change.\n\nI think if other companies want to compete with Blizzard, they have to start taking notes about these kinds of things.\n\nI know you're disappointed about the lack of innovation in the core gameplay, but if you loved Starcraft, chances are you've played some user maps.  I think you'll certainly find something for you in all the maps that will be released.\n\nSeriously, everybody is raving about how Little Big Planet, Spore and Banjo-Kazooie are the heralds of a new age of gaming in which user content is primordial, but Blizzard has beaten all other companies to the race.  Warcraft 3 is proof of that.  And Starcraft 2 will continue the tradition.","c071mu7":"also known as the \"xbox tan\".","c071p1q":"Try not to fuck with them. Also, not anyone.

For gaming, the 360 is the better buy. For overpriced PC competitor, you go with the PS3.

The PS3 has 429.\n\nWow. Only 429. I mean there's 150 more shitty games for me to have to sift through not play on 360. I totally made the wrong choice.\n\n&gt;What does that prove? Isn't this your argument here?\n\nThat proves that there are games to play for 360, as I was proving (and you did yourself with those numbers) that there are plenty of games to play for PS3. Anyone who says otherwise about both systems is a tool.\n\n&gt;For one, I was saying that when compared to a PC the PS3 is overpriced.\n\nBut compared to a Lamborghini it's underpriced. You're being silly. PS3 is a game console, comparing it to a PC is silly.\n\n&gt;Only a fool buys the \"console wireless gaming adapters\". You can get nic-&gt;wifi adapters for pretty cheap.\n\nThe only actual wireless adapters that work with the xbox are the criminally priced official, and still overpriced knockoffs. There are bootleg methods but it's not like you're doing it for under $50 (I tried, we just went with a long ass cable). \n\nBut to the point. My PSP has wifi. A DS has WiFi. There's no fucking excuse for an Xbox not to have it, and the price they charge for the adapter is disgusting.\n\n&gt;It's not $50. It's not required.\n\nI didn't see any $3\/ month option when he bought it. I saw $49.99 upfront. It's required if you actually want to enjoy half the content of the games you pay for. If you own an Xbox for 5 years that's $250 or $180 by whatever $3 monthly plan you managed to get.\n\n&gt;If he chooses to not invest in a recharge kit, that's his shortcoming.\n\nWhich is $20. PS3 recharge kit? $0. Get it?\n\n&gt;Let's say he got the 360 core ($300), added a 120gb drive ($130), and got a charge kit ($20). That's $450.\n\nAnd Xbox live, since launch, which would be $150. So that's $600.\n\nA PS3 started at $500. And had bluray. Overpriced? Now, of course, it costs $400. 360 $300, but the addons haven't dropped much and still, again, put it over the PS3 price if you want to actually enjoy your games, download stuff, and recharge your controllers.\n\n&gt;Bluray player, media card reader.. Neither of which are essential to gaming.\n\nPeople who own video game consoles do more than just play games with them. Welcome to 1996.\n\nIf you just want a barebones, cheap system to just play games on and never go online, you should be buying a PS2 and buying used games. Much better value, if that's all you want, than any of the current gen systems.","c0727v6":"&gt; So by your logic, then WoW and other MMO's are based on ransom?\r\n\r\nNo, they are providing the servers to play on.  See, this complete and intentional ignoring of logic is why I think you are a fanboy.\r\n\r\n&gt; Gee, I wonder how that's similar to Xbox Live?\r\n\r\nAn instant messenging service?  Not too similar actually.  MS forces all online games to use live, does not allow any alternative way for people to play online, and forces you to pay a monthly fee just to be able to play (on someone else's xbox, not an MS server).  If they were charging money to provide a service that would be fine.  Go ahead and make gold accounts special, but let silver accounts play the games they bought.","c0727wb":"Not true.  I didn't log into XBL for over a year (back with the xbox 1), but I still paid the $50\/year and my account was just fine.","c0728nk":"&gt;Wow. Only 429. I mean there's 150 more shitty games for me to have to sift through not play on 360. I totally made the wrong choice.\n\nIt was directly in response to the comment where you imply the PS3 has more games (and btw, many of those shit titles are on both systems). Both systems have only about 100 unique titles (PS3: 96, Xbox 360: 103). This comment was the one I was responding to:\n\n&gt;Really? My brother has one and I have a PS3. I have more games and he's always begging to play mine (he's an MGS fan).\n\nThis means nothing. You're saying because you own more PS3 games than your brother owns 360 games it makes it a better system. I own more 360 games than my friend has PS3. Does that make the 360 a better system? No, of course not. That's a piss-poor argument (one that you made).\n\nThere are more 360 games in existence overall than the PS3, does that make it a better **gaming** console? Arguably, yes. The entire point of owning a **gaming** system is the **games**.\n\n&gt;But compared to a Lamborghini it's underpriced. You're being silly. PS3 is a game console, comparing it to a PC is silly.\n\nPS3 is a \"game\" console that tries to be a PC too, and hasn't really succeeded. It is a competitor to the casual PC gaming market, and Sony markets it as such (or did at the start). If I had compared the PS3 to a space heater, your example may have worked.\n\n&gt;The only actual wireless adapters that work with the xbox are the criminally priced official, and still overpriced knockoffs. There are bootleg methods but it's not like you're doing it for under $50 (I tried, we just went with a long ass cable).\n\nUm..You're buying the wrong gear. There is no such thing as a \"game console only\" nic-&gt;wifi adapter. WiFi is WiFi is WiFi. The same goes for a 10\/100\/1000 network. This is industry standard technology that doesn't give two shits about the type of data transferred over it. Get a standard nic-&gt;wifi adapter. It doesn't require the Xbox logo to be on the packaging. They work exactly the same. You've fallen for marketing (\"It doesn't say game on it, it won't work!\"). Don't blame your ignorance on others.\n\nThis argument is kind of lame because you could buy a PS3 without wifi at release.\n\n&gt;I didn't see any $3\/ month option when he bought it. I saw $49.99 upfront. It's required if you actually want to enjoy half the content of the games you pay for. If you own an Xbox for 5 years that's $250 or $180 by whatever $3 monthly plan you managed to get.\n\n...or you can do this thing we like to call \"shopping around\". You can go to Best Buy and pay $2000 for a notebook, or you can go to NewEgg and pay $1300 for the same thing. It is very easy to locate 12+1 month gamer cards for $40 (and apparently $30 now based on a comment above).  $3\/mo for a far superior online service isn't that bad of a deal. If you don't play online all the time you can get 1 day, 3 day, etc cards for far cheaper. The price is negligible.\n\n&gt;Which is $20. PS3 recharge kit? $0. Get it?\n\nMy point was that the 360 with all the gaming accessories was still cheaper than buying a PS3 for the gaming aspects. If you are shopping for a **gaming** system, and buy a PS3 or a tricked out 360.. You'll save money with the tricked out 360.\n\n&gt;A PS3 started at $500. And had bluray. Overpriced? Now, of course, it costs $400. 360 $300, but the addons haven't dropped much and still, again, put it over the PS3 price if you want to actually enjoy your games, download stuff, and recharge your controllers.\n\nThe 360 costs $200 now (it's gone down in price too, you know) and comes with more (Games, hdmi, more value added features). The PS3 actually has fewer features now than when it was released (Card reader, hardware based PS2 compatibility, fewer USB ports, etc). The PS3 had to have set some sort of record for most features removed in the least amount of time on a game console.\n\nI don't have an Xbox Live gold account. I've played online quite a bit (free trials, and promotions from MS like last December). You don't **need** a gold account to \"actually enjoy your games\". They're quite fun regardless of online play.\n\n&gt;People who own video game consoles do more than just play games with them. Welcome to 1996.\n\nNothing I like more than using my Wii to browse reddit and make comments! Or installing Linux on my PS3, so that it can be an overpriced PC! Yes, people use their consoles for more... But the console should still excel at its primary function. Stapling a card reader to the front doesn't help gaming aspects in any way.\n\n-------\n\nThat being said. I have owned a PS3 (twice). I played the Xbox far more. The online system was far better. The Xbox is the better buy for a person who likes to play games. The Wii is the better buy for the person who has a lot of friends over. The PS3 is the better buy for someone who values media (music, video) and other frivolous (in respects to gaming) additions.\n\nThere is no contest, and it is silly to try and say there is.\n\n[Wii &gt; 360 &gt; PS3](http:\/\/nexgenwars.com\/) in terms of sales. This is a market fact.\n\n(From Wiki)\n\n&gt;[Playstation 3](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Playstation_3#Sales_and_production_costs): 16.84 million (as of September 30, 2008)\n\n&gt;[Xbox 360](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Xbox_360#Sales): Worldwide: 28 million (as of January 5, 2009)\n\n&gt;[Wii](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wii#System_sales): \tWorldwide: 34.55 million (as of September 30, 2008)\n\nIf the features of a PS3 really outweighed the price, or the price was really not too high, or it was the far superior console... Shouldn't it be in first or second and not dead last? The Wii and 360 are neck and neck.. The PS3 has practically 1\/2 the total sales of either.\n\nThe Wii is market leader due to low price and games.\n\nThe 360 is runner up to due price, games, and online service.\n\nThe PS3 is dead last due to price, slow start for pumping out games, and online service.","c0728w3":"Happened to me as well.

If every xb360 gamer canceled their Live subscription MS wouldn't have an incentive to change the price point unless they all went out and bought a PS3 or PC as well and stopped buying xbox games and hardware because that is where MS makes its money.

Nobody can offer an alternative 360 multiplayer service, which was the whole point of that hypothetical. Since people don't choose their console based on the multiplayer (which I noticed you didn't try to refute) and since console's OS are locked down, your multiplayer options are limited to who produced your console. Since, as I pointed out in the last post, you don't buy your system based solely on the multiplayer network many people own a 360 who begrudgingly pay the price because they own a 360 and want to play it online. That comment about if they could switch their multiplayer network without switching their console has nothing to do with Sony. The PSN was used as an example because it is an extremely similar system, but at the free price point. Since XBL only indirectly competes with the PSN and Steam, it doesn't have to react to their price points, if it did have to compete directly it would, as I stated in my hypothetical.\n\n2. You conveniently ignored my point that XBL cannot be compared with a MMO because they are not apples to apples. If you want to try to compare XBL to something compare it to Steam, the PSN, Gamespy, or Games for Windows Live which would be valid comparisons. One of the main points of this whole argument in the first place was that an MMO and XBL are not similar due to inherent differences and thus not a valid comparison.\n\n3. http:\/\/www.xbox365.com\/news.cgi?id=EpFpEkpuVpeLYzoSmP0450\nhttp:\/\/www.shacknews.com\/laryn.x?story=19054\n\nHey, Steam betas before XBL, imagine that.

Hell, I never even say any multiplayer service is better than the other, except on the price point. This discussion was only ever about the XBL pricepoint, and yet you somehow think it is about the console itself. It isn't and it never was.\n\n5.

However, I am first and foremost about games.  If a good game comes out on Wii, I'll buy Wii just to play it.  So far that hasn't happened.  Wii has no games I want to play.  Further, I've played Wii for a few hours and I hate its controller for 2 reasons: I feel a constant lag, and the pointer is not visually synchronized with where I am physically pointing the stick, while it does have some laggy tactile synchronization.\n\n&gt; Go buy R2\n\nWhatever.

All volume levels *except for the dialogue* of course. It's so loud that the damn thing just comes out as distorted rusty machine-gun noise even with the TV volume way down into the single-digits. It's a blatant \"loudness war\" stunt that fills me full of hate for the game, regardless of how good the rest of it might have been.","c078w2n":"im not an apple fanboy but i really do prefer a mac. a big reason for this is i own an xbox 360 and a wii so i dont play games on my computer.","c078yzc":"I have utorrent setup with an rss feed from tvtorrents.com.

I never have to download anything, its already there when I'm ready to watch it. My shows usually show up on the rss feed a few hours after they air, its even quicker if you donate and get on the premium tracker. \n\nThis is the real model for internet TV, downloads in the background totally unattended. I wouldn't mind a few un-intrusive ads. Most of the \"legal\" content has really annoying ads, and require click through or clicking fullscreen after every ad, etc...

I have 1900x1200 resolution, do you even get 1080p?\n\nWell look, my point is this.  Not only do I have way more power, but I can do way more.  PCSX2 and Dolphin are crushed by my system.  Turning the FPS limiter off can give me frame rates up to 400% normal speed.  So, I get almost all last gen consoles on my system.  \n\nPlus, I get the versatility to do what I want.  Your theory is flawed, and it's just like switching to OSX.  I know MAC isn't cheaper, but you'd think that everyone would switch to OSX because it's easier to use and arguably more secure than windows.  Well, OSX still has a 10% marketshare.  Do you know why?  Because OSX doesn't have the software freedom that Windows and Linux have.

Society has basic needs like roads, street lights, community programs to keep kids off the streets, public schools to keep the masses educated, small business loans to build local economy, grants to send kids to college. You stop paying into that system under the premise the more money in your pocket means you can spend it more wisely and the system collapses. You give people money they spend it on useless shit, instead of paying down debt, buying homes, or supporting their family. Community projects and social programs are a far better use of money (yes, Socialism!), and should taken from people's paychecks. One fewer xbox game, and a couple of meals at McDonalds in order to support my local economy and infrastructure. Taxes benefit you, Stop thinking taxes are a penalty! Our country was built on taxes and public funding. Sense of entitlement is insane these days.","c07a4ov":"&gt;Look man, we live in a society.\n\nOf individuals, each with our own wants, desires, talents, capabilities, and thoughts.\n\n&gt;Society has basic needs like roads, street lights, community programs to keep kids off the streets, public schools to keep the masses educated, small business loans to build local economy, grants to send kids to college.\n\nSociety does not \"need\" anything.  Society is all of us individuals.  Each individual decides what he or she needs.  If an individual sees that other people are willing to pay for something that they need, then that person will work to produce for that demand.\n\nFor you to sit there and armchair philosophize what \"society\" needs, which means what millions of separately thinking individuals need on their own, speaks volumes at the height of your pretentiousness and arrogance.  Let the individual people fucking decide what they need.  You do not tell other people what they need.  They do.  You only decide what you need.  If you want something, you pay for it.  If others do not want it, they won't pay for it.\n\nThis is called having respect for the existence of individual life and individual happiness.  Collective group think and superhuman omniscient deity like planning have already been proven to be a failure with the collapse of socialism in the 20th century.  People are born free, and no amount of laws or authoritarian decrees on where things get built for individual people will never stop the inherent drive within all humanity to be free of the bullshit of people like you who want to spend other people's money and think that you can spend other people's money better than they can themselves.\n\nIf massive theft and already refuted central planning is what you call \"society\", then I want no part of the society you live in.  I much rather prefer staying free of your patronizing bullshit.\n\n&gt;You stop paying into that system under the premise the more money in your pocket means you can spend it more wisely and the system collapses.\n\nOn the contrary, society collapses once a central planner makes all the decisions.  F.A. Hayek has already won a Nobel Prize in economics showing how societies collapse when they become centrally planned.  Leaders of such societies have no access to the price system for the means of production, which results in economic chaos, shortages, unemployment, and eventually tyranny.\n\nThe only thing that holds society together is individual liberty.  Empires characterized by government planning and oppression have come and gone hundreds of times throughout history.  The US was the first country to be built on libertarian philosophy, and is the *sole* reason it became the best country to live in that the world has ever seen.  We are moving away from freedom.  It is little wonder why society is collapsing.\n\n&gt;You give people money they spend it on useless shit, instead of paying down debt, buying homes, or supporting their family.\n\nOK, by that absolutely tyrannical logic, you should have no problems with me coming over to your house, taking everything you have, selling it all, and giving all the money to the government, because according to you, they allegedly spend money better than the people do.  This will be the perfect way that the government can finance another illegal war in the middle east.  What amazing foresight you have!  Fuck medicine and food and clothing.  Finance what the government wants!  They know best!  Ever read 1984?  Brave New World?  Ya, your thinking is taking us all there you pretentious douchebag.\n\n&gt;Community projects and social programs are a far better use of money (yes, Socialism!), and should taken from people's paychecks.\n\nIf they were so valuable to people, they would finance them voluntarily.  If you value them so much, send them a check yourself.  You will not be able to force anyone to pay unless you have the government's skirt to hide behind.  While they use the guns against the people, you are there hiding behind their skirts yelling \"yeah, get those bastards!\", like the little coward bitch you are.  I dare you to come over to my house and try to steal my money.  I dare you.  Of course intellectual cowards like you much prefer if the government IRS goons did your dirty work for you, so that you don't have to get your well-manicured hands all fouled up by me shoving them up your own ass.\n\n&gt;One fewer xbox game, and a couple of meals at McDonalds in order to support my local economy and infrastructure. \n\nStalin would have been proud.\n\n&gt;Taxes benefit you, Stop thinking taxes are a penalty!\n\nIf taxes really benefited the people, then they would not have to be mandatory by law you fucking sheep of all mankind.  People would be lining up to pay their taxes just like they line up to buy things at Best Buy.  Obviously people's *actions* totally refute your baseless claims.\n\n&gt;Our country was built on taxes and public funding.\n\nNice try at rewriting history.  Our country was *actually* built by capitalism.\n\n&gt;Sense of entitlement is insane these days.\n\nYou feel entitled to have more than you have now.  You have a sense of entitlement to the fruits and incomes of others.  And you have the gall to accuse other people of having a sense of entitlement?  Your whole post is one giant call for taking money from other people.  If that is not entitlement, nothing is.  You have the sense of entitlement, with your calls to take the money of other people.  The people who simply want to keep what they themselves earned are not the ones who have a sense of entitlement.  *You* do.  *You* want want want.  But nowhere do I see you offering your whole paycheck to the government.  You want others to give, against their will if need be, so that you yourself can have your subjective highest valued ends met.\n\nWhat you have to learn, ASAP, is that your subjective ends are no more valid, nor less valid, than any other person's ends, in the epistemological sense.  We are all created equal.  We all have the right to make our own choices, even if those choices are not satisfactory to you personally.\n\nOnce you start down the path of thinking that you know more about people than the people do themselves, the sooner the country falls into dictatorship.  The country was built by people who wanted that to stop.  The people who started this country wanted out of the British Monarchy's grip.  They wanted to co-exist by free trade.  *Not* central planning.  *Not* government \"infrastructure\".  *Not* by a sense of entitlement, like you have.\n\nGo to North Korea if you like central economic planning so much, and let people live free here.  Freedom is becoming more and more valuable, because we are getting less and less of it, and morons like you are cheering and applauding as the Titanic sinks.","c07a5tp":"&gt;I also enjoyed the subtle cockgobblery that zune and xbox2 owners exude.\r\n\r\n&gt;And don't buy an XBOX2 like a foaming-at-the-mouth lobotomized fuckwit.\r\n\r\nUh, what's an xbox2?

The article says:\r\n\r\n&gt; www.current.com.au wrote recently According to an EB Games store manager, who wished to remain anonymous, failure rates for the Xbox 360 have dropped in recent times but still outweigh hardware failures for competing consoles. \r\n\r\n&gt; \"We are definitely getting faulty hardware returns of the Xbox 360, but no-where near as much as we used to when it first came out,\" he said.\r\n\r\n&gt; \"On initial launch, it was close to 30 per cent of our [Xbox 360s] were coming back faulty...The failure rate must be well over 30%\"\r\n\r\nThat number is from an *unsourced \"EB games manager\"*. Current and Smarthouse are notorious plagarists and content theives.  They are not journalists, they are a traffic-trolling shithouse set-up to generate ad revenue.\r\n\r\ncurrent.com.uk is owned by Smarthouse. They create a story of fiction, then post various stories in a traffic-trolling circle to give them exposure.\r\n\r\nSmarthouse (and their proxy current) is solely the source of the general internet urban myth of \"30% failure of xbox 360s\".  That very article is what started that number.\r\n\r\nIt was widely repeated.  It is not accurate.\r\n\r\nWhat *is* accurate?  I dont know.  MS has never released any numbers themselves, but looking at the provinece of smarthouse\/current and the very article itself, it's pretty clear that \"anonymous EB manager\" almost certainly doesnt exist.\r\n\r\nThe only reliable number was released by 3rd party warranty provider SquareTrade.\r\n\r\n[They said in Feb08 that the number is half as much](http:\/\/www.1up.com\/do\/newsStory?cId=3166259)\r\n\r\nA couple of things about what FairTrade *actually* said.\r\n\r\n* A) They said that they've had a \"failure\" rate of 16%.  What do they mean by \"Failure\"?  *any contact of \"failure\" is counted as a \"failure\"*.  So, 16% doest mean \"people with a general hardware failure\", it includes people who've called for *any reason*.  ie: Customer: \"My xbox 360 wont turn on.\" SquareTrade: \"What's wrong?\".  Cstmr: \"I dropped it in a mudpuddle\" is counted as a \"failure\" and included in the 16%.\r\n\r\n* B) SquareTrade direclty profits from the impression that Xbox 360s *need* 3rd Party Warranties.\r\n\r\n* C) The SquareTrade CEO said \"* \"would estimate most if not all were the original motherboard.*\" ie; a version long since gone from retail.\r\n\r\n* D) This number was released in Feb 08, as the problem with heat was actually fixed in summer-2007, the number of \"non-rev1\" Motherboards (the one with the heat issue) has decreased dramatically as new-non-heat-issue MBs have entered the pool of Xbox 360s.  ie: the \"failure rate\" depends on the population total, as the heat-failure-prone MBs decreased as a percentage of the total, so will the overall \"Failure rate\".\r\n\r\n* E) \"the general hardware failure accounted for about 60% of those hardware failures\".  So, 60% of 16% (or, 9.6%) are the the general hardware failure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBottom line?  The Xbox 360 heat problem is long since over.  The owners with problems get free repairs.  The \"30%\" failure number is utter bullshit. ","c07eelc":"I use an old xbox with XBMC, which uses mplayer (can offset audio amongst other awesome features). Plays every filetype I throw at it.

I guess in today times, most magazines simply can't afford to not have support by the few publishers that are left and game developers, that often impose or threaten to impose media boycotts, if ratings are not working out to their expectations, I guess this is a symptom that results from the high budgets involved, interest overlaps (as game mag staff tends to fill PR \/ Community functions at game studios \/ publishers) and the reliance of game mags on filling material  as previews, DEV diaries, DEV interviews and development updates (Which seems to be more important than updates in other industries, i.E. music \/ TV movies). \n\nAside of that, metacritic user rating is pretty much skewed for the most prominent titles because of the ps3\/xbox360 fanboy rating wars.

That's what I did when my xbox360 failed.  I couldn't be bothered to deal with the bullshit (my time and health is worth more than that), so I just got myself a new one, and the new one worked fine.

Come on guys, it's not like this hasn't been solved before.\n * **Living-Room HDTV FOV** wherein anyone with a widescreen monitor doesn't get extra visual space added to the left and right, but instead gets visual space *removed* from the top and bottom. The end result? Feels like you're \"zoomed in\" all the time. Very disorienting.\n * **Inventories are hard, let's go shopping!** wherein the idea of saving items for later use is clearly retarded because people want action, and besides, the artist didn't draw any inventory screens for us so we can't implement it. *I want to save that booze and chocolate bar for later!*\n * **Our 3-year-old demographic keep getting killed early on, and their mums are very upset about it!** wherein dying is like, a massive downer, so we we'll just send the player back to the nearest rejuvenation tube with no penalty whatsoever, *thus eliminating any tension the game might have had*.\n* Oh, just go watch Yahtzee's review, it covers a lot of the rest.\n","c07nc5e":"I have to?

Or the xbox console that everyone already knows about?\n\nUnless MS are intending to significantly ramp up their hardware offerings, I doubt these stores will work any better than regular retail. \n\nI personally feel these stores will work against MS. Apple have the advantage that all their hardware+software works in a streamlined fashion, this can be presented in the store. If MS have a bunch of laptops running Vista, it will become painfully obvious that Vista doesn't really offer much more than what consumers already know about.","c07nd28":"Looks like Sony's gone from top dog to last place. Mabye if they would have focused more on gaming and less on movie playing and bullshit features the xbox wouldn't be kickin it's ass.","c07nd5m":"Check out the performance of the Sony stores. Sony like MS, don't need a retail presence to make themselves known. Retail makes sense for Apple, it's cheaper than constant top-of-mind advertising, and it caters to the apple self-selected market and curious potential \"switchers.\"\n\nRetail is the poker equivalent of laying your cards on the table, and it's not something you do if you're showing a weak hand. Apple can do it because their line up is specifically targeted. Sony and MS offerings are more finance based (what makes the most money?, what are other people doing to earn their cash, ipods?, what is hot right now, online stores?) as a result of that their line up is inconsistent, rudderless and junky. They still have occasional good products, but what is the point of a glowing-amazing-laptop, if it's surrounded by cheap LCD photo frames, crap digital cameras of innumerable configurations, over priced memory sticks, all sorts of plastic stereos, randomlypriced head phones, amafessional SLR offerings and countless other heat-of-the-moment incarnations.\n\nMS are basically the same company when it comes to their choices of hardware, it's purely what they can sell. A mouse, a keyboard, an xbox, a bombing music player. Apple at least go out on a limb and provide products that fill out their line up regardless if they are big sellers or not (home media, the digital hub and quick access entertainment). A good example is the appletv, which isn't a big earner for apple.\n\nSo I congratulate MS for trying, but I suspect they'll be no better equipped than Sony.. which is finding great difficulty in even [filling their stores.](http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/05\/27\/business\/yourmoney\/27digi.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=2)\n\n\n","c07ndm6":"How much profit has Microsoft made from it's xbox division (ever)?","c07ne7h":"The Xbox division doesn't need to make a profit.

When it all boils down, it's all about *who* is in each community, and *what* 'societal' norms are present on each. Besides that, here are my insights about 4chan, reddit, and digg's response to the video:\n\n***4chan***'s structure is basically *designed* for raids. They have the speed of discussion needed to really get shit done, and are really engaging for the 'viewer' (the feeling of accomplishment at sticking out from an anonymous crowd is quite something. Having your actions advance the herd towards a specific goal). Embedded photos help a bit as well. But, more importantly, the fact that they--in a way--*practice* for this sort of stuff to happen. Between each big raid, they've got all sorts of mini-'projects' going on. They have people who know their shit.\n\n***Reddit***, in contrast, is less speedy, less intense, and less experienced (experience in raid-like activities). Also a bit more careful, due in part to the lack of anonymity. However, our strengths are our structure, syntax, permalinks, and perhaps even the ability to contact specific users who may be of use.\n\n***Digg*** [was](http:\/\/digg.com\/pets_animals\/Idiot_abuses_cat_on_YouTube) quite the disappointment. I keep seeing on there the descriptions, \"You know what to do,\" yet nothing really gets done. Personally, I think the comment structure is ultimately to blame, and the submission-promotion system is second to blame. If you don't feel like following the link, the comments were either along the lines of, \"we (anon\/internet) will fight you,\" or \"this is terrible\", and the rest being an update message-board for what developments were happening on other sites.\n\n*****\n\nWe've got to give \/b\/ a round of applause for being caring in this situation. There was a great divide (and still is) about whether anon should have been on the kid's side or the cat's side. Luckily, it swung in bias of the cat, thank god. I found this a notable quote, pardon the language:\n\n&gt;TO ALL NEWFAGS\/MIDFAGS PRETENDING TO BE OLDFAGS:\n\n&gt;\/b\/ isn't heartless, \/b\/ is indifferent. Sometimes Anon takes the side of the abuser, other times the animal. One day they are fapping to CP, the next getting a pedo arrested and outed. We hate niggers at the same time were getting a White Power radio host off air. That is what makes Anon great. We do what we fucking want.\n\nWhat I've seen in the past while is organized interaction on the internet to get shit done. Quickly, and effectively.\n\nWe have the potential to do so many amazing things. I hope that you all see this. Tracking down an xbox thief, saving somebody's life, and restoring someone's hearing. These are all rather tame compared to what we are capable of. I mean, really capable of.\n\nBut, let's not forget that we are also easily lied to. Not only are we capable of intentionally bringing a shitstorm to some wifebeater's front porch, it isn't too difficult to visualize us unintentionally doing the same to an innocent victim. All I have to say is... be careful.

Every single time I have had this issue, I only needed to pick up the phone, dial the xbox support number, tell them my situation and they would promptly send me a box to put my defective unit in to send away for repairs.  I would usually get my fixed 360 a week later. It's NOT a big deal.  Actually, it was nice to have a legit reason to back away from the 360 and enjoy real life for a bit.\n\nThe most recent 360 that broke (a month ago) was actually a beneficial situation.

The sweet spot for new computers is the Q9550 and friends in the sub $800 US home PC market, and that's only because of the Nvidia nForce 9400, if there is no comparable chipset for i7 they are never going to get the i7 into the same spot after the standard quarterly sets of price reduction.\n\nRight now you are looking at twice the cost to get in at the low end of i7, part for part, and the only thing driving it is a handful of PC game titles. What I am seeing is the majority of people being hit by the economic crisis no longer have the money for a $2000 game system. The solution is get a bang for the buck desktop, and give the kids an xbox, wii, or playstation.\n\nAnd given the economic outlook the $200-300 game console with the $500-$800 PC beats the $2000-$3000 PC even with financing. The price point for a living room HTPC is no longer $1500, but rather a $300 pico-ITX competitor for the game console purchase. Clearly Ion if it ever ships will own this market, being that the main criteria is playing 1080p content as it becomes mainstream over the next several years.\n\nSo my question is who is going to buy i7 this year at twice the price, given the lousy on-board chipsets? Are corporations going to be subsidizing i7 in this down turn? Are home users?\n\nI don't think so.

As the video above shows, it can be made with a dollar's worth of parts and very little technical proficiency. From the Wikipedia entry on online game cheating:\n\n&gt; &gt; By attaching a physical device (called a lag switch) to a standard Ethernet cable, a player is able to disrupt updates\/communication from the server with the intent of tricking the game server into continuing to accept client-side updates (which remain unimpeded). Since the client game-player is impeding the reception of information download, on the client game-player's side the opponents will slow down or stop moving, allowing the client game-player to more easily shoot them, block them, out-race them, etc. From the other players' perspectives, the person using the lag switch may appear to be teleporting, invincible, having delayed animations or fast-forwarded game play, or the player may simply find themselves losing to an invisible opponent.\n\n&gt; Though I'm not a gamer, I found this cheat to be particularly interesting since it abuses the very mechanism that's supposed to make gameplay fair and smooth for players with differing connection speeds. The hack essentially interrupts the Rx pair of the ethernet connection, while allowing the Tx pair to continue transmitting. The game is designed so that in a normal lagging network scenario you can shoot at other players in the location where your game client perceives them to be. Otherwise, you'd have to be predicting the future, aiming at where the other player will be seconds from now when their network packets finally arrive. Shut off only the Rx pair, and your game client can only interpolate the location of the other players; they effectively stop. With the Tx pair still active, your client is still able to send collision events to the server, making your opponent dead (and you a cheater).\n\n&gt; I don't think this is a new hack by any means, so chances are there are games that are affected, and many more that aren't. Any regular gamers out there want to chime in on what games are most affected by this? Is the practice common? It seems like this would just about completely spoil an otherwise fun experience.\n\n&gt; * [How to Make a Lag Switch](http:\/\/www.metacafe.com\/watch\/1980838\/xbox_tricks_how_to_make_a_lag_switch\/)\n&gt; * [Wikipedia: Online Game Cheating](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cheating_in_online_games)","c07saby":"Looks pretty cool.

Everyone else connects to them. What these idiots do is figure out who they are connected to for the game they are playing, and then DDoS them.\n\n The person who everyone else is connected to is the host, and they are generally the person with the best connection. The host is also the person who has the Official Game State. What their Xbox says is how all the other xboxes see the game. If it looked like a sniper round hit someone's head on an off-host xbox, but the host says it didn't, then the round didn't hit. (It looks like it hit to the off-host dude because of predictions by his xbox. The prediction was wrong in this case.)\n\nObviously, the host has somewhat of an advantage here since he knows exactly where everything truly is, not just where it's predicted to be. So these idiots just DDoS them until their connection drops. A little screen pops up and the host migration process has begun. The idiots then check to see if they are the host. If not, they then repeat the process. \n\nEventually, either they're the only ones left (win!), or they have host (fairly big advantage). \n\nThat's my understanding of it at least. So whenever this topic comes up on the forums, people always say \"Well why not use a dedicated server?\" Bungie always replies that it's simply not feasible for a game the size of Halo (player-wise) to do such a thing. The number of servers would be tremendous for this case, and there'd probably need to be a price-hike for Xbox Live. Further, they'd need to be all over the place, since otherwise the people who lived really close to the servers would be at a tremendous advantage. Maintaining multiple server-farms per country, for all major countries...? Maybe that's not the best idea...","c07tx6h":"Playing games on PCs typically isn't worth the frustration.

The host's xbox would have to keep track of what it *knows* to be the game-state, and also what it wants its player to think is the game state. I'm not sure if this is truly in everyone's best instance, since it adds more work for the Host's xbox, which degrades the performance for everyone connected. Technically fairer (if you can give a fair simulation of latency...), but at a fairly large cost. \n\nPlus I'm not sure how you would be able to fairly give lag. Check the latency of all other players, taking the average? Imagine if there were 4 other players. 3 have a latency of 20ms, one has a latency of 100ms. Suddenly the host has a (totally artificial) latency of 40ms. I'm sure they'd be able to come up with a better system than that, but see above.\n\n[Side note: a few of the actions in Halo 3 are determined with the help of latency. If two people run up to punch each other, there's a window of a few ms where if the other person punches, it counts as simultaneous, to take into account latency. While in this example, the host is fine (I think the window is 90-100ms...), it's certainly easy to think of times when he wouldn't be!] \n\nIn most cases, the connect speeds are good enough that there isn't a terrible need for this kind of action. Yea, the host does have an advantage, which has nothing to do with their skill at the game. But generally it isn't so much that the effects are truly noticed. Bullets that appear to hit not hitting happens only in very large games (12-16 player games, from my experience) where the host's xbox has to coordinate a lot of things at once. Or in cross-continental games, but things will always be bad for that. The speed of light sure isn't getting faster...","c07u1cz":"Halo 2 was really simple.

And i assumed 4 games a year as a minimum. If you buy more games, then the price difference favours the pc even more. If you wait for their price to drop, pc games' price drops too. But most people buy games when they are new.\n\nPS I guess using logical arguments and real facts is considered trolling now? Or is the \"console gaming is cheaper than pc gaming\" ingrained so much into your brain, that any other opinion is automatically considered trolling?","c07vejf":"Well if you play PS3 online, you will greatly appreciate how nice the xbox live experience is.\r\n\r\nGreat system for playing with friends, everybody has a headset compared with PS3 where absolutely NOBODY has a headset. \r\nYou can review players, and avoid them if you want, also report those with racist names, and it filters out a lot more of the crap by forcing people to pay.\r\n\r\nYou have a lot more retards on PS3 who play because they can, versus the xbox where people have paid and they want to play.\r\n\r\nI remember when I got my PS3, went online and was very disappointed, I'm used to it now, but it still doesn't compare to my xbox when playing online.","c07vfxe":"I kept it simple, and bought an old xbox of craigslist with DVD kit for about $50 and stuck XBMC on it.

I've actually had experience designing fullsize levels to take advantage of portaling technology, and it can be a real pain in the ass. :-D\n\nThe amount of memory available to a system like the xbox360 or the ps3 is disconcertingly small. There are a lot of tricks like reusing multiple textures across rooms, leaving stuff in global memory, and dynamically streaming in\/out assets in order to present a fresh gameplay experience.","c07vjj9":"Hey everyone. Some one will probably beat me to leaving my comment because I haven't prepared it yet.\n\nTonight I got bummed again. Depression sinks in fast but it feels like a slow tug boat that picks up speed. like a weight attached to your heart that gets heavier by the minute. \nI've been spending the past days with the recruiters trying to get into the army. not sure it's looking good though. My past really may fuck me over. All because of shit i did when i was 15.\n\nThat has really bummed me out. Because I don't know what I want to do in this world that I really don't want to be apart of. I just wish i could close my eyes and escape this plane and goto a divine plane that explodes with joy. But im an atheist and as much as i wish, i have no reason to believe on exists.\n\nIve still been getting bummed about the ex-gf issue. I fucking hate and love her. I hate her because she wrote me off so fast. That possibly hurts the most. That after the two years we were together, she is fine and im so crippled by it. It feels like love has been an illusion and i finally realize it. Because if i house so much undying love in me that it hurts just to breath with out knowing the bond is there, then whats wrong with her. Why is she able to do it? \nI often feel like an alien on this world. I feel like while humans need water and food to survive, i NEED love. not as a desperate mean to be happy or attention, but i LOVE to be in love. i live for it. it is my greatest joy in this world to love. But she keeps on going.\nAnd I cant forget her which sucks. I tried while I was on my way to the recruiters this morning at 8 am, a fucking Lotus Elise goes by, her name is elise. I'm like ... COME ON!! ITS EIGHT AM! fuck you god. this is too early for you to fuck with me. Then when I have forgotten her and Ive been going to court houses and my high school with the recruiters, on the way back another one goes by! ugh. What bad luck huh?\n\nI tried to go out and have fun tonight but that fell through just like last night. Thank god I have xbox360 and love playing COD4 online with people or i would go nuts.\n\nI started to get sad and feeling very lost in this world again. I was scared of where my mind might lead. So with haste i came to this site and started to catch up on other peoples posts. I am very glad to see others who feel just as bad coming to reach out too. I wish i could give them helpful words because it really does feel better to come reach out and have people who want to connect. it really helps. But i almost feel like im not equipped to say anything.\n\nSo still feeling bad I decided to write this. I just need to get that weight unhooked from my chest. One good tool I have to feel better is Ravi Shankar. That man is amazing. But to be more specific, one album is what helps me the most. It was ravi and george harrisons last album together called Chants of India. They took hindu prayers and made beautiful and inspiring music out of them. It really is able to help neutralize my bad emotions and make me feel better. I think its partially because it helps spark the love in me. I have a file thats translations of the songs and they arent just normal prayers. they are awesome, they ask for peace to every living thing, to be shown the beauty in which all is made of. really nice things. I haven't been listening to it enough.\n\nI just wanted to share that with everyone and hopefully it can help a person relax when they are in a chaotic state.\nhttp:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ravi+Shankar\/Chants+of+India\/Omkaaraaya+Namaha\nThere is the link to last.fm site with a song that I enjoy quite a bit, its not too long but nice.\n\nmay there be peace, peace, and perfect peace","c07vr40":"Presently, the PC has many more updates.

Said friend also happens to be black. He puts on the headset, I see a look of shock come across his face as he says \"aw, what the fuck\" and then goes off on a vulgarity-laced tirade.

By applying Family Settings to an associated account at sign-up, you may, among other things, help to prevent any user of an associated account from making additional purchases and from having access to voice and video chat, which is intended to diminish the ability of such user to communicate with other users.

I picked up a PS3 a few months back, and it's actually saved me some money in this regard.\n\nI was considering buying a brand new computer in order to play the latest games, but I realized that outside of gaming all I really did on the computer was develop code for microcontrollers, write up reports in latex, and the usual generic internet\/coding stuff. So I'm holding on to my current box as long as possible, now that I take care of my games with the console.\n\nAs for systems, I really enjoy the PS3. Nobody questions the fact that it's a far nicer piece of hardware than the 360, and titles developed exclusively for the system (killzone stands out at the moment, having spent the day with that) look better than anything out there. It's got a great library of games, an online store with a bunch of sweet, quirky indie games, and works as an awesome media center\/bluray player. Plus, and this stands out at me because my roommate has a 360 and they sit side by side, the PS3 is far quieter than the 360.\n\nMain disadvantages would be that the online support isn't nearly as good as the 360 and it's more expensive.\n\nSo my advice is here, I guess. All signs point to a PS3 price cut within the next few weeks, and if they bring it down to 300-350 it'll be directly comparable with the $300 xbox (there's no way you want the $200 system, it's missing a couple hundred bucks worth of stuff :P). I'd look at the exclusives for each of the consoles to see which appeal to you more, and if it's a tossup I'd say go with the PS3 as the hardware is going to age better. If you have lots of friends who own either system, go with that one :).\n\nPS3 exclusives (off the top of my head):\nLittleBigPlanet\nMGS4\nUncharted\nKillzone 2\nGran Turismo\n\n360 exclusives:\nGears of War\nFable 2\nMass Effect\nForza\nHalo 3\n\nJust about everything else is available on either system.","c07y759":"I think the Xbox is probably more cost effective even if it breaks sometimes. \n\nIt's made to entertain 1-4 people.

Prices have fallen, but the push for Core 2 and games that can take advantage of them has game requirements moving at a face pace. \n\nId say it's not a bad time to get into PC gaming more, but it's still not cheap. Soon we'll see much more powerful graphics cards as they take full advantage of multicore processors on video cards or move it all to CPU's which will be 4 and 8 core by default soon enough. \n\nI like PC because it's a lot easier to 'test' the games out before you buy them. Beside that it's kind of a pain in the ass, especially for just playing games with a couple friends. Consoles are just more user friendly and you can invite a couple people over and all you need is a few extra gamepads not entire gaming systems per person. BUT... most people need computers anyway, so if you do the purchases well you can get a nice computer and add gaming easily enough with a high end graphics card. I tend to think console gamepads are superior though and many PC games aren't even designed for gamepads it's and afterthought at best.\n\nThere are also great deals on used consoles and overclocked PC's are cost effective right now as are quad cpu's. Everything PC is historically cheap right now, it's def a good time to buy. \n\nYou could probably build\/buy a decent gaming system for 500 bucks with today's prices, including a 17 inch LCD if you don't already have something better. \n","c07y7or":"A multi-platform title, that is only downloadable, short, cannot be resold, and only carries a 'brand' name is not worth $20.

You will see PS3 games looking better and better, but I think the only time you'll see a ps3 looking better than 360 game (same game) is when the 360 is disc space limited.  The DVD is the worst part of the 360, everything else is incredibly well balanced.  If you start running into bottlenecks on the 360, you usually have plenty of trade off options.  On the ps3 when you hit an issue you have few options, weak gpu, weak memory architecture, weak CPU.  The spus are the only option, and they are not always a very good option. ","c07z0fi":"...and that's why every multi-platform game is developed first for the xbox 360, then ported to the ps3 in the last few months of development.

Although my gf spends a lot of time on it,  I don't play it that often.   I do use it as my media center since it supports DLNA\/upnp (as does xbox I think) and it works quite well.   I may have been more enticed to buy an xbox if the controllers didn't feel so out of sorts when I try to use them (I'm an avid rom collector (I' have a sad number of roms,  my total archive of digital media exceeds 1.5tb...)

The problem now isn't so much my satisfaction as Sony's market viability,  I'd be willing to spend more money to them if they had more games.  so this manner of engineering is somewhat ridiculous,  but they're not losing a customer,  just title purchases.","c07z72q":"&gt;...and that's why every multi-platform game is developed first for the xbox 360, then ported to the ps3 in the last few months of development.\n\nThis isn't true and, moreover Perry said that because programming for the PS3 is harder you should develop for it first.","c07z8cu":"Until late last year (if not still), the development tools for the xbox 360 have been *lightyears* ahead of the ps3 tools. PIX is extremely powerful, as is the cpu profiling tool. Why would you develop for a platform lacking these tools first? Nobody does, unless you are making an exclusive ps3 game.\n\nIt's not like I'm saying that development *starts* for the ps3 late in the game. The ps3 is accounted for in the engine design process. The engine is initially implemented for all platforms at least to the proof-of-concept stage. However, when production begins the ps3 takes a back seat while the xbox 360 continues to be optimized so that production remains efficient. At my current studio, we just maintained a ps3 build in cruise control to make sure it still compiled. We also had one graphics programmer spend a (small) portion of his time maintaining the ps3 build. The project I worked on before this was similar. The project before *that*, we did nothing to maintain the ps3. 2\/3 of the way through development we farmed out the ps3 build to another studio (man, it must have sucked to be them). I also have several friends at other game studios and the best I've ever heard of is 1 dedicated programmer assigned to making sure the game runs on the ps3 and a system of rolling off programmers onto ps3 optimization as features were locked down in late development.\n\nFor the last two projects the ps3 has turned into a nightmare at the end, with too much to do in too little time. We fire up the ps3 to realize that the frame rate is abysmal and there are several huge issues to contend with. We try to push as much as we can onto the SPUs, etc. but its hard to get creative so late in development. Things get hacked up beyond recognition and we cut every corner possible because we don't have the time to do it right.\n\nTo avoid all the heartache you probably *should* develop for the ps3 first, but it's hardly realistic. You don't want to be battling the hardware while trying to get new features in for immediate consumption by the artists.","c07z9yt":"I have bluetooth on my laptop and 2 USB controllers.

I know this can be done but thats not what I want.","c07zdko":"does this review stand out compared to others?\n\nhttp:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/games\/platforms\/xbox360\/streetfighter4","c07zgbq":"One this is old.\n\nTwo Hirai is a nut job.\n\nThree, an actual product that people can buy can prove the PS3's power (not power OVER the xbox 360, but it's competence at producing incredible graphics despite development \"difficulties\"), rather than odd PR talk.\n\nFour: The ten year plan means they will support the console for 10 years - the PlayStation 3 came out in the PS2's 6\/7 year, but is supported well into the PS3's lifespan.","c07zgqy":"To me, the reasoning in all of this is similar to other things in the industry. C-like languages are more popular because that form of syntax is familiar to many developers. It doesn't mean it's good, or that the runtime is the best for all jobs; basically, it is like applying the hammer to screws. If a system only supported lisp\/scheme for programming, or *gasp* apl ... it would not do well, and deemed \"too difficult\" to develop for.\n\nI see the path that MS is taking; starting with the Xbox, they tried to make a system that was basically like a PC. That meant game developers were prepared to develop for it right away. I mean, the system had a version of Win2k on it! It had no real barrier to entry. The PS2 was criticized for the same reasons as the PS3, but it was a different time, and DVD helped it gain momentum. Sony took the same attitude; that's why you still see sales for PS2, while the Xbox died years ago. \n\nSo,Sony tried the same thing again. Add high technology, and hope it hangs in there long enough for the competition to be woefully inadequate, and require hardware updates. This time, software prevailed over technology. I don't know what developers use to make games on the PS3, but developers can use Visual studio to make games for the Xbox 360. Anyone can, and will, make games for it. Afterall, a good portion of developers might use visual studio at work (if they are not game developers as a trade), so they will already be familiar with it. Also, the xbox 360 doesn't have such an esoteric hardware design. But, it certainly doesn't have a lasting design; there will be a new system much sooner than PS3 needs an update. But, knowing how consumers are, if they release a new system for cheap (nevermind any subscription fees that make the system much more expensive over time), that will kill the PS3.\n\nPraise microsoft on their knowledge of consumer behavior and developer mindsets. Do not praise them on their system design; they are software people first, and made a system for the least common denominator; a jack of many trades, but master of nothing.","c07zh6u":"&gt; they are software people first\n\nTrue, but somehow their hardware generally ends up better than their software.\n\nIn this case Microsoft made hardware that the average person could afford.  The subscription fees make it cost a lot more in the long run, but this is a smaller cost each time (more importantly it is optional - most of my friends with an xbox360 are not paying a monthly fee).  \n","c07zh9e":"True, but the 360 has been out for a while.   Microsoft can now start working on the xbox500 (or whatever they can it), and have something that blows the ps3 away just because there is newer technology that the ps3 couldn't get.  Because the xbox is generally mainstream-ish hardware there are other elements of scale that help make it cheaper.  \n\nSony could well end up with the ps3 which is slower than the next xbox, harder to program, and just as expensive.   Of course this is a game of one-upmanship.  They can build the ps4, but will they make the same mistakes?

Bear in mind that it appears Asian game developers have a much different development attitude and enjoy the challenges posed by the PS3 architecture.\n\n&gt; (psxextreme article concerning textures and animations)\n\nPerhaps Uncharted 2 is fantastic looking; the screenshots certainly look nice, but there are equally graphical intensive games on the 360. Gears 2 looks great (despite the fact that I don't like the game or the aesthetics), and so do Far Cry 2, Resident Evil 5 and a few other games in development.\n\n&gt; Either way, amount of processing power used is a poor metric for quality.\n\nYou are right in saying that percentage of processing power is a poor metric for quality and that optimisation takes time to figure out a new platform, and my point is that 360 developers are now being able to optimise for the platform instead of still struggling to simply use the basic level of the architecture. This optimisation will provide leaps and bounds in graphical integrity.\n\nMy main point keeps seeming to get buried, however. I have never viewed graphics as the bleeding edge of video games, and I have been trying to make the point that the simpler architecture on the 360 leaves more engineering cycles to work on more efficient tools and *gameplay* considerations instead of having to concentrate on simply making the game performant on a new architecture. I know that at the studio where I work we are able to invest significantly more time in tools engineering than ever before, because we have a stable and performant engine on the 360 platform, and these tools are paying off with tighter iteration times and consequently more finely polished end results.\n\nAs for groundbreaking forthcoming 360 exclusives?

You just want the pretty picture of the eagle being around.\n\n\"I want to know how factory farming hurts biodiversity more than the destruction of an entire genetic lineage.\"\n\nControlling the evolution, development, breeding, and essentially removing livestock from the environment has had a huge impact on biodiversity. Far more than the death of this one bird.\n\nYou are trying to make the second option more impressive using biased language. What's worse for your health? Eating half of a cake or an ENTIRE strawberry?\n\nHeh, the fact is ending this particular ENTIRE species has very little effect, partially because it was going to die anyway. But removing livestock from the environment and taking control of them has caused many more species to die.\n\n\"While we're at it, why don't you put value on different forms of life?\"\n\nI do. You are the one who turned this into something about value. I already said I understand why you might value something differently than something else. The fact that you are still focused on that makes it obvious you aren't really understanding what I'm saying.\n\n\"Do you not cherish the things you have less of more?\"\n\nNot necessarily. It's far more complex than that.\n\nI live with two family members. I have two of them. But I only have one Xbox. Should I cherish my xbox more than my family? \n\nLet's open it up to my extended family. I've got more female family members than male. Should I cherish the males more?\n\nBut the fact is, we are still comparing apples to apples and oranges to oranges but that's not what the eagle vs. chicken situation is because you DON'T care about the chickens. Your analogy fails because in your analogy you like both candies. But you don't \"like\" chickens. You \"hate\" chickens.\n\nBut you've made your answer clear I think. This Eagle was like a rare painting for you. You are upset because you don't get to look at the painting anymore. But you don't really care about it beyond that.","c086xjp":"What else do I need to qualify as carting about something in you book? If it has an emotional and scientific impact on my thoughts and feelings, do I not care about something?\n\nYou're completely wrong about your \"factory farming hurts biodiversity more\" argument. I don't think you really understand what you're saying totally, so I'll explain how you're wrong as simply as I can.\n\nControlling the evolution, development, breeding and essentially removing livestock from their former homes really doesn't do any heavy damage to biodiversity. Farming has been around for what? A couple hundred years? Even if it were thousands (and it might have been as little as I know my history), you wouldn't see any harsh differences in the evolutionary chain. \n\nI understand your confusion, but pigs and chickens wouldn't have been out there creating new species in such a short time, that's just not how it works. The death of the eagle destroys the ENTIRE lineage of that bird. It will never reproduce again and there will probably be no more Iberian eagles. Nothing has prevented new species of farm animals from arising because factory farming is a relatively new practice of artificial selection and while it does change the amount of new animals produced or the manner in which produces them, it doesn't do enough damage to stop or heavily alter flow of genetic information.\n\nThe death of the eagle is blocking genetic flow because it cannot pass any genes on to any children now. All our farm animals still have the ability to breed with each other and cause new mutations.\n\n The death of a species does more damage to biodiversity than factory farms because factory farming is a relatively new process that doesn't destroy entire lineages of animals but rather alters their breeding patterns and lifestyle. While without a doubt cruel, it doesn't harm or impede genetic flow in any significant way. \n\nAgain, I know this must be getting old for you, but you didn't really provide any evidence for your argument; you're a hypocrite (and a blind one at that). I've at least made my argument easy to understand with analogies and descriptions of emotional and scientific relevance and tried to expound of those issues. You, on the other hand, simply spout whatever backwards credo you've been taught with absolutely no backing. If you really are correct about your statements, I'm going to need to see an explanation, rather than a restatement of the topic I've questioned you about, as you have done with the factory farming and biodiversity argument.\n\nI turned this into something about value so you could get it into your head that there are good reasons to cherish the eagle over the chicken. Those reasons, as I stated before, are: emotional and philosophical relevance to commonly accepted ideas (underdog credo) and scientific relevance.\n\nThe eagle wasn't necessarily guaranteed a total destruction either at that stage. There could have been more eagles out there and a breeding program could have been set up. Even after death, the eagle still has a chance at resuscitation. http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/scienceandtechnology\/science\/sciencenews\/4409958\/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html\n\nYou still don't seem to be clever enough to understand my analogy, as your criticism was pretty stupid. You don't have one xbox. You can go to the store and buy a new xbox. You only have two family members. You cannot replace them by going to the store. If you had only one male family member when compared to a heavy population of female family members, you might cherish the male family member more or show an altered form of attention and appreciation for him being the only family member. Being the only male family member doesn't guarantee special attention because of your rarity, but I can easily understand how someone might show special attention to the only male family member they have because they can provide something that female family members perhaps might not.\n\n   Ignoring the fact that there are heavy differences between comparing an eagle and chicken,a human being to a video game system, and males and females, your attack on my comparison falls completely flat on its face.\n\nYou're trying to tell me how I feel about things when you have no indication other than what I'm saying. And I don't believe I've changed my mind about anything yet. If I eat chickens, I enjoy the taste of them. I like chicken. If I am moved profoundly (as you said, like a painting) and can see the scientific significance of the eagle, I like the eagle. Comparing appreciation for two different things by making them two different color candies still works to prove what I'm saying and your criticisms seem shabby and usually don't relate to the argument I'm making.\n\nThe eagle was not only similar to a rare painting, but was something with definitely scientific relevance and use. It's not only a personal thing for people, this eagle, whether useful to use or not, can now never been studied or investigated ever again. Chickens, on the other hand, are in high supply.\n\nI'm pointing out that it makes sense for people to care about the eagle more because it was the last of its kind and posed a distinct relevance to them when compared to the farm animals they eat. It's not about suffering. Both animals suffered and farm animals continue to suffer. I can't expect people to care about the suffering of other creatures, but I can expect them to find reasons beyond that to find value in them.\n\n\n\n","c0875bn":"Orb works. \r\nwww.orb.com\r\n I haven't used it ina while but it connects with my xbox360 and my xp box.

I don't have to take up MythTV tinkering as a hobby to keep it going either.\n\nSo overpriced?  My time is worth more than ten bucks a month and my wife needs to be able to use this thing.\n\nUnder featured?  The only thing I'd like is for multi-room viewing of recorded content.  Rigging up something with a Myth TV recording and my old modded xbox playing it in a different room would work but it'd still be a time sink and my wife would hate it for several reasons.\n\nLess freedom?  I agree.","c089pbh":"For the longest time moore's law was key. The same pricepoint would get you the same quality machine in the grand scheme of things. I haven't even looked for a gaming machine in years (ever since I got my xbox).\n\nI shouldn't be surprised how low the prices are now that computers are very mainstream, but yes this thread was started due to my ignorance in price points.","c089sle":"Get rid of xbox 360's Rings Of Death in 30 mins or less... or your money back! RROD FIX","c089t43":"Reading is hard! Let's play xbox!","c089xc9":"kinda, I remember Terminator 2 did the same thing, I think on the genesis? so you could use the gun or the controller.  Same deal with House of the Dead 3\/2 on the xbox.\n\nI don't think Time Crisis did that though except for the scope missions in part 3, I can't remember about silent scope.","c08a16w":"From what I read it was completed on xbox 360, maybe someone could leak it, and somehow we could run it?","c08a30q":"http:\/\/forum.teamxbox.com\/showthread.php?t=447361\n\nClassic internet response.","c08a38e":"it's okay, this is gaming reddit, you can say *xbox live* here\n\nall of the trolls, racists, and ten-year olds are gone, you're safe with us ^_^","c08a5a6":"theres a reason that PC gamers aren't allowed to play vs console players: on a level field PC gamers will always win.\r\n\r\n\r\nmaybe this is just me, but i prefer precision of motion to crappy controlling.  i've played FO3 on both mediums, and one of them was decidedly suckier controlwise (also because the xbox wont let you install fellout, arrrgggg its so green)","c08a6gw":"I would sign up in a SECOND if Netflix was available to me through my xbox live subscription. But thanks to retarded distribution schemes, not only can I not sign up, there is much content unavailable to me through the xbox store, including games.\n\nI have the money, I am willing to pay, but I don't live in an 'approved' area so I get screwed.  Local videostores are going bankrupt from rampant piracy (you can buy pretty much any current movie without getting out of the car).  Who wants to rent year old movies when you can just buy the latest releases while waiting for the traffic light to change?\n\nDo away with regions and foreign release dates, and you save the movie studios.","c08ad9b":"turn off xbox, check reddit while watching the late news then sit back and fall asleep on the couch until 3 am then get up and stumble to bed to wake up at 5:45am for work. ","c08ag4t":"Microsoft learned from this mistake with the original xbox, the bundled HD and Blu-ray make it impossible to achieve the low price point threshold first.\n\nWhat this means is that Microsoft is able to hit all of the important price thresholds first, so people waiting until the next gen consoles reach 300, 250, 200, 150 and 100 dollars will all buy an xbox.\n\nThe saving grace that Sony has is that the xbox 360's hardware has a bad reputation because of the red ring of death.","c08aqgg":"You are wrong, as people who do not subscribe to xbox live still get the updates.","c08avjc":"Comparing the xbox however, solely for the purpose of 1080p, this is favorable. On the PC side,most people don't have PC compatible TVs and those that do usually don't even know it. ","c08azat":"I was *glued* to this. Captured the spirit of HL, that's for sure. The unique ideas weren't overplayed and were presented well.\n\nAt some point (soon I hope) we reach this level of realism in games. Yay!\n\nThen right after we hit photo realistic games, skynet happens. I'm pretty sure xbox live is involved somehow.

Sure he may not have his saved games, but there are a lot of games that don't require saved data to play the game 'normally'. Having 50 games I'm sure he at least has one or two of those.\n* Tech support is not in the Philippines, and why does it matter if it is?  The fact that he continually repeats that suggest to me that he has some racism issues. \"I have nothing against Filipinos.\" kinda puts the nail in the coffin.\n* There is a simple effect method of backing up your hard drive. Google is your friend. I've noticed people who lose data always complain there's no easy way to backup their data... mostly because they've never actually LOOKED before.\n* It's easy to get a person on xbox's support line. Once again, google is your friend.\n* It's not the manufacturer's responsibility to deal with DOA purchases usually. He should have taken it back to the retailer. If the retailer was online (as it was, newegg), then they should have overnighted him a new console. That has nothing to do with entitlement, but it's good customer service.\n* disclined is not a word\n","c08dyj3":"I wanted to play SW, but I never had an xbox.\n\nI do, however, have a 360 and I still want as well ^_~.

How is Halo wars, a game for xbox 360, going to affect starcraft2? They're 2 totally different games. One is just a casual RTS based on the halo atmosphere and nostalgia, while the other is a game where you're going to pull 250 APM and is obviously meant as an e-sport. Why even compare these?","c08f2kx":"I'm playing Star Ocean on xbox360 now and thankfully it's not asking me that dumb and annoying question.\n\nI think it comes down to very poor Microsoft game development guidelines.  Microsoft should specify to all their licensed game developers that you never ever want to ask for storage device if the hard drive is available.\n\nThere should be a setting on the xbox360 itself to specify where to store save games.  Once you set it, all the games should honor it from then on.","c08f2th":"No flame bait friend.  I own both xbox360 and PS3 and many things are better on PS3.  I think people deserve to know that.\n\nOverall I think PS3 is much better.  The only thing I like better on xbox360 is that the games on it tend to have the full 1020p resolution more often.\n\nIt's just an opinion.  At the same time, if Square Enix continues to make games like Star Ocean for xbox360 exclusively, you better believe I will own the 360 and I will want xbox360 to be a decent machine that's friendly to gamers.  So even though I prefer PS3, I still want Microsoft to fix all the xbox360 problems.  In particular I don't like the new dashboard -- too much advertisement on it for my liking.  On PS3 I have to login to the store to see the advertisements and I can turn off the tiny ticker in the upper right hand corner.","c08f32u":"&gt;tend to have the full 1020p resolution\n\n???\n\n(kidding, I know what you meant)\n\n&gt;In particular I don't like the new dashboard -- too much advertisement on it for my liking\n\nJesus christ yes, this is ridiculous. I paid 300 dollars (give or take) for a console. 60 bucks per game. 50 bucks a year for xbox live. Is this not enough money?\n\nI can't believe microsoft has the audacity to bombard the dashboard with ads and \"featured content\" - I mean I know they generally only advertise stuff specific to the 360 but come the fuck on. When people open windows there aren't any ads for the new version of MS Office - why should I be bombarded with ads for Street Fighter?!","c08f3al":"Ahh I see, kudos for the detective work.

There's still some good left in this world","c08f3xf":"Here is one for you guys. Why does my 360 always load my girlfriends account and not mine.

The only thing I like better on xbox360 is that the games on it tend to have the full 1020p resolution more often.\n\nPS3 has no where near native 1080p resolution. The games run at a lower resolution such as 640p or 720p and are then stretched out or \"upscaled\" to 1080p. The only console that can run games at full 1900*1080 is a PC, and will be at least until the next generation of consoles enters the market.","c08fc8e":"Paul K.

It's more speculation about which platform is the \"best!\"\n\nWell, sales-wise, we have no idea without sales numbers from Steam, D2D, EA Store, XBOX Live, and PSN. Retail numbers show the PC getting pummeled everywhere but World of Warcraft and the Sims. However, we KNOW Steam is doing work sales-wise; they made the Audiosurf guy a rich man.\n\nQuality-wise, we're again ambiguous. A top of line PC puts all the consoles to shame, but are the games better? Most PCs are pretty bad, too; so do you take the average PC or the best PC to compare to a console?\n\nThese kind of assertions are pointless without sales numbers or some other hard data, but we'll keep seeing them as each tries to flog their platform.\n\nFor the record, I prefer the PC but I have an xbox and a Wii that I play regularly.","c08ffz9":"[Take a look here then](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gaming\/comments\/870h4\/new_gaming_system_could_threaten_xbox_ps3_and_wii\/)\n","c08fg88":"I am wondering about the economics of this. Rather than have the user pony up for the hardware (computer or cheaper xbox 360) the company has to buy an expensive PC to run the game on for each user that is logged in at any time. You probably can't share the computer over multiple users; and you can count on a single user demanding 100% of the resources of the server as long as he is logged in. So if 10,000 people are playing at once, you need 10,000 high end workstations, excluding monitors. So if peak usage is 30,000, and 50,000 people pay the fee, you have to pay for 900,000 worth of workstations plus T1, corporate, etc... what do they have to charge?","c08fgme":"Hmm... maybe you should lurk more on gaming sites: http:\/\/www.joystiq.com\/2008\/10\/13\/microsofts-nxe-storage-solution-free-512mb-memory-card-or-20\/\n\nI feel like what they did was probably as good as they could do considering they had messed up from the beginning and should have had hard drives in all systems from day one. Sucks that you didn't hear about it.\n\nOh, one other thing. There are apparently ways to hack a certain model of drive into working with the 360. I think it has to be one of the exact models that is used in the 360 hard drives, which is kind of lame, but at the least you can get it for significantly cheaper than what Microsoft charges you.

At first, they weren't going to offer rain checks or substitutes, but after some haggling they finally relented.  They promised if I paid for it up front, they'd get it in and give me a call.  They did exactly that.  I was giddy about my purchase and completely forgot all the struggling it took to actually buy the TV.\n\nAt the same time, they had Ninja Gaiden on sale for the 360.  $9.99.  Of course, this wasn't in stock either.  So I asked for and received a raincheck.  Fast forward a month and half.  I hadn't received a call or anything regarding my raincheck.  I went into the store and found the game in stock and back up to full price.\n\nI attempted to purchase the game, but they told me my raincheck was \"cancelled.\"  I was surprised and figured it was just a computer glitch (Best Buy is notorious for their \"computer glitches\").  They informed me that rainchecks are only good for 45 days (my raincheck was approximately 48 days old) and then are auto-cancelled.  I asked why they hadn't called\/emailed me regarding the raincheck when they received stock (as per their policy).  They stated that it had just come in stock that day which was an amazing coincidence that I happened to visit the store.   I spoke with the customer service manager who stated that it was just bad luck on my part that they hadn\u2019t received the games earlier and that they couldn\u2019t honor the raincheck.\n\nThe net result was that I left sans game and I felt like they had actually had the product earlier and had dropped the ball on contacting people with rainchecks.  They succeeded in squandering their good will from the TV for a stinking xbox game.  I could have understood if the raincheck had been months or even weeks out of date, but mine was a few days.\n\nPerhaps I'm being unreasonable.  I agree that rainchecks shouldn't be open for an unlimited time.  However, I'm still annoyed that the one day I happen to visit, I find the product on the shelf and my raincheck canceled.  I find it frustrating that they won't extend the raincheck 3 days because it's against policy.  The good will I had towards them?  Completely gone.\n\nBest Buy?  Worst Lie.\n","c08g3fx":"&gt;You didn't specify. Now that your opinion called me elitist you piqued my interest to show your opinion up.\nFirst, the computers reliability and variety of uses outweigh many of the consoles on the market. I love my consoles but my PC is my prime player.\n\nI have never had a console fail, freeze, or get a virus. I still have a Sega Genesis that works. I have however had plenty of computers fail, freeze, or get assaulted with malware in the past. Troubleshooting a computer can also be a major PITA, it has plenty of points that it could possibly fail at and with custom built PCs you are responsible for running down everything. If a console ever broke I would just send it in and be done with it, sure it would take time but there would be no hassle of hunting around.\n\n&gt;I never said there was a problem with past support as all the new-gen consoles support their old generations (one back minus most PS3 consoles).\n\nI was just trying to figure out what your concept of upgradability was. Every few years you can buy a new console for $200-500 and it will still play all of your old stuff. With a PC you may switch operating systems, which can break previous games. For example 98-&gt; XP, XP-&gt; Vista, both of these transitions can have problems with games that worked perfectly fine on the previous system.\n\n&gt;Additionally, if your computer is loud, you need to buy fans that have a low decibel rating and a high CFM rating.

They are loud machines and the xbox 360 was a PR mess until M$ forked over a billion-odd dollars to increase the warranties of RROD machines.\n\nMy X360 and girlfriend's Wii are pretty quiet, at least I have never noticed either as loud or disruptive. Additionally, like with any Microsoft product I waited a year or more to purchase my X360. MS has a track record of releasing pretty unstable stuff initially (in my opinion).

Just look at the state of development for PC today, besides a few publishers like Blizzard and Valve it is always developed for last, after the 360 and PS3.  Why?  Because the developers make their big money off of these systems due to the piracy rate being much much lower even though way more people own pc's than xbox or playstation.  \n\nI look forward to this system and hopefully it will bring back pc gaming to the forefront.","c08g4fm":"to me, SoM is the greatest multiplayer RPG I've played.

The only thing being sent to the server are commands from the controller.\n\nI really have no idea what OnLive is but just from reading it sounds like a game system where all the rendering etc are done on a cloud and then the video just is streamed to your pc\/tv. That of course would require broadband just like any video streaming would. There is no reason that I can see why it would need a lot of upload bandwidth. Most broadband plans have horrible upload speeds. My bandwidth is like 6mbps down and 500kbps up.\n\nAgain I really have no idea what OnLive really is but I can't imagine any reason why it would need 5mbps upload speeds.\n\n&gt;More explosions mean larger demand on the video streaming?\n\nWhy would a video stream change with more explosions? All the rendering is done server side and you are just watching a video of it. It doesn't matter how many polygons there are. The bitrate and resolution are the only things that will affect your video stream. The higher the resolution and the higher the quality the faster connection you need. \n\nMultiplayer also doesn't affect this. You can have 20 different multi-player windows and the server is still streaming the exact same amount of data. All the video processing is done on the cloud.\n\nYour questions seem to show a serious lack of understanding of how the streaming video and cloud computing works. Their servers do all the processing and rendering and they just send you a video stream. You have a controller that sends their servers messages that they process and render and stream to you in video. This is why you could play it on a crappy system or even a TV with no processor. All you need is broadband download to stream the video. It's like watching a youtube video. It doesn't matter how many explosions or how many pictures inside a picture there are. The stream is exactly the same. The only difference is that this stream is interactive and being rendered realtime.\n\nImagine that your friend has an xbox hooked up at his house and a webcam pointed at his TV. He hooks his controller up so you can remotely control his Xbox from your house over the internet and you can watch what you do through the webcam.\n\nYou are playing from your house but his xbox is doing all the processing and then the webcam just streams a live feed. It doesn't matter what games you play. It could even be an Atari or an Xbox360. Your requirements don't change. The streaming video from the webcam doesn't depend on the graphics or anything else. \n\nThis is basically the idea but instead of one xbox there are a bunch of computers all together doing the processing and instead of a webcam it's a direct video stream.

I'm currently on a student network and getting stable lossless 8ms ping to a city 480km away (300 miles). 8 ms could mean it's playable, and 8ms within 480 km is more than enough to cover a big city with a single data center, hell even a small country. \nI mean, lcds had delays longer than that not long ago, and games were playable on those.

So just buy value for money, save money and when needed just buy a new pc.\n\nPS Generally you must avoid to be cpu bottlenecked because most games have plenty of options to downscale gpu load, they dont have many options to downscale cpu load. So if you are cpu bottlenecked, the game might become unplayable, even with all the settings set at lowest level.

(3) This conviction entirely different than Google's involvement with the Yahoo Acquisition.\n\nReally, you're so used to seeing MSFT fanboys and hatred that you instinctively view strong conclusions as evidence of one or the other.\n\nAs for the predatory pricing issue, I was referring to Microsoft's xbox division as a whole.  Yes, everyone knows that these companies use the hw as a loss leader.  However, other companies plan to turn a profit after sw is factored in.  MSFT in earlier conference calls had stated that they never intended to make a profit on xbox.  Now, perhaps they just have a really long term (10-year plus) plan to turn a profit, but if that entails edging out competition by losing money until then, it would be an anti-competitive move.\n\nYou're also mixing up terminology.  Don't get mixed up with the hardware-as-a-loss-leader\n\nAs I pointed out in an earlier post, I was referring to Microsoft's entire xbox hw\/sw operations.

There all so eager to push FAUX dominance that the only thing they can do to assure themselves of superiority is by stooping to believing ignorant trash about their \"competition\" FUCK YOU and the majority of the ignorant jock 360 gamers.\n\nHow the fuck do you figure ps3 is dying off. Its amazingly popular all over the world, but its being beat by xbox here. Look in japan, where the machine is based out of, its the leading console (not counting the wii, but who counts the wii anymore..) Honestly its people like you who are destroying a once proud gaming culture, diluting people who actually DO have refinement and taste with shit like you.\n\nThe ps3 gets nearly ALL of the same games as the 360 does. 360 has more because they started earlier. Every game that MATTERS is multiplatform. 360 has gears of war, THATS IT. Halo is about as UNREFINED as you can get when it comes to ignorant hype over a sub par shooter. What else is there thats so greater than the ps3 aside from the RPG support microsoft shelled out massive amounts of cash to obtain, to appeal to the rest of the gaming world, and not just xbot fucktards? They failed, as the majority of 360 players ARE just xbot fucktards.\n\nAt least i had the assurance of knowing my console isnt just going to fucking tard out one day, and i dont have to spend money on upgrades for fucking wifi and HD gaming, or online, and ps3's online works fine, i never get any problems its very stable and reliable and if you believe otherwise then your just wrong. Its that simple. Besides, ps3's exclusives beat the fuck out of all the cookie cutter fps that 360 calls exclusive. Ninja Gaiden yeah we get that too.\n\nLike i said before, get a fucking clue\n\n\nSo...any thoughts, comments?  Please feel free you douchebags.","c08lyuv":"I dont really have a problem with microsoft or xbox as far as the company and console is concerned. Although i do believe the ps3 is superior in many ways.  One shining example is the lack of fucking ignorant xbot fucktards spewing racist bigotry all over their games. I don't have an issue towards the 360, just the retards that fucking play 360 and think there so superior.  Its fucking pathetic.  I also dont approve of microsofts aggressive business tactics when it comes to rpgs, but its a business so what can you do.  If anything, if the trend continued i would eventually buy a 360 just to play the rpgs, and i own a japanese console -_-;","c08m21m":"Hrmm, I loved Puerto Rico but I didn't like all the little pieces\/clean up.

I'll admit that i was pissed so i was ranting.\n\nYou dont like rpgs, so the fuck what?  Many people still do like rpgs that doesnt make you any better than anyone else and your view on the ps3 is still completely ignorant.  Halo is a piece of shit and \"pop\" culture is just that, pop, and no one gives a fuck about cookie cutter conformist bullshit like that, at least anyone who can think for themselves.\n\nGranted rpgs can be cliche, but not all rpgs are good rpgs.  To bitch about rpgs the way you do is like bitching about first person shooters and how in every FPS game, its First person, you aim, and you shoot.  FPS follow their formula and rpgs follow theirs and if you don't like it then its your problem.\n\nAs i said before, rpgs, like any other genres are littered with cliches.  Halo is a walking cliche of the gaming \"pop culture\" that i've grown to despise as they buy into stupid hype over sub par games because they just don't know any better, and they don't know any better because they were never gamers until it was made popular by xbox, and ushered in people who dont know a fucking thing about gaming, yet desire strongly to be a leading voice in their newly obtained hobby, so they go around ignorantly running their mouths and and everyone just jumps on the bandwagon, because thats what everyone else is saying.\nThe fact that  halo was getting its massive popularity that is proof, as that popularity  should belong to something more like portal, or half life, something thats actually GOOD.\n\n  You don't hear very many people talk about THOSE games, unless they actually have refined taste and most people i speak to who play 360 dont.\n\nNote im not talking about people online but people in real life, average every day people who never gamed before it became the next big thing in the retarded pop culture which is naturally filled with morons who can only follow.\n\nYes, i do watch anime but im hardly a \"japanophile\"  and what it comes down to is the fact that you just feel that your superior because i enjoy things like anime and rpgs.  I dont pretend to be japanese, im not obsessed with anime and now YOUR the one jumping to conclusions.\n\nI judged you as a 360 fanboy because you only hear this ignorant \"anyone who plays jrpgs and likes anime are faggy japanophiles\" kind of talk from them, and other closed minded pricks.  That line of logic shone through in your original post and yes, i DO take offense when someone blatantly insults things that are my hobbies and are signifigant to me.\n\nI was never bashing the 360  I have NO ISSUE with microsoft, or the 360, but since you insisted upon throwing a bunch of stupid lies about the ps3 like not having any good games or install base, i thought i might as well list the 360s ACTUAL PROBLEMS.  NO i wasn't thinking of the ps2.  Ps3 is only somewhat unpopular here because 360 is now the majority of PEOPLE PLAYING GAMES, (but NOT GAMERS.) due to xbox hype by the pop culture who know NOTHING about games.What i hate about the 360 is the massive hordes of completely ignorant shit heads like you who take it upon themselves to look down on others due to their lack of understanding for the genres they condemn with such a passion.\n\nNice, telling me to get a life thats a good one. Normally it was the jocks or the \"cool\" guys who would always say that to us gamers, and now its at this point where people cant even talk about, and then defend(due to retarded statements like yours) their console or their genres without ignorant closed minded opposition, which seems to come from most 360 players because they feel so mighty for some reason.\n\nGo ahead and think what you want about anime, and about jrpgs.  You lack the capacity to enjoy them for what they are, and thats no reason to condemn those who dont.\n\nThe ps3 doesn't nearly have as many quality titles as 360 does? It Doesnt have a decent install base?  Complete and utter 360 fanboy propaganda. \n\nIm not denying 360's superiority with the POP CULTURE in THIS COUNTRY (which is fucking retarded in the first place) but to say that the ps3 is a BAD console, and then continue to spew that retarded propaganda about how 360 is better because jocks and frat boys now call it home is completely ignorant.\n\nIm sure you've heard of Halo Wars?  Well maybe then you might be aware of the fact that as an RTS its a fucking joke, its a dumbed down piece of crap they made to try and bring all the new gamers into something other than FPS, which is why they get the simple watered down version of an attempt of RTS.  Thats the Halo series shining for you and all you xbox jackoffs who cant get the fuck over themselves.\n\nThe fact that they have to release dumbed down RTS games in the consoles most popular and best selling series (which created xbox's popularity in the first place...) just proves my point about the majority of people who play 360.\n\nAlso nice, calling out my grammar errors, it just goes to show me that your willing to cling to any reason to convince yourself of superiority. You elude to something completely off topic like that because in your mind, its just another edge you have over me. It was a rant, not a fucking essay you douchebag.","c08mqj5":"I stream music and radio from the internet, play xbox live, and download and watch tv and films on a regular basis.

He wanted to trade a 360 straight across for an iMac.  Also, he said, even if I don't want the 360, I could sell it - so basically, since I was trying to sell the iMac to get cash, I would end up having to sell yet another thing, which is worth less, and will take more work, and is also not entirely legal.

There are devices you can get to turn the mouse and keyboard signals into analog inputs for you, like the 360Sniper, but it's not great. Analog inputs have deadzones and such that basically kill the refined controls you get from a mouse. They also have a maximum input amount, where mice have no such thing. The best solution is to run the inputs through a PC and back out to the xbox\/ps3, but this kind of defeats the purpose of just having a console.","c08vgya":"So did you play it on the xbox and love it, or were you a normal person and played it on the PC like everyone else?","c08vksc":"I'm personally not against a tiered system, but the price they have set is stupidly high.  $150 dollars when I normally pay 50 dollars?

IMO watching CNN passively as a form of entertainment is pure escapism.

A few days later, after being a douchebag to me, I told him to give me the controller back. He kept being a douchebag until I got in his face, at which point he tried to brush it off saying, \"Haha, man, I was just fucking around, chill out.\" When he realized that I still wanted the controller back, he suggested we go outside.

When I showed him [this](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_best-selling_music_artists) page, he laughed and quoted the line \"the sales-figures within articles published by reliable sources may not be 100 percent accurate,\" as if this meant that Phish--a band that's not even on the list--was in fact at the top of the list. He tried to give me a music history lesson, saying that \"you have five basic genres that music evolved from: classical, jazz, the blues, rock, and country.\" (If you know anything about the history of music, this is hilarious. If you don't, it's the equivalent of saying \"There are 3 basic sciences: sociology, psychology, and math.\") When told that there was no single greatest musician or band--because that is a matter of opinion--he said that some opinions could be wrong and some could be right.\n\nHe went halves with a friend of mine on an oz. of cocaine.

When my friend came back, my roomate told him that someone had broken into our house and stolen it, so he wasn't going to be able to pay for his half and he expected my friend to pay. My friend told me about this the next day, and I told him that not only was I there when he did it, he kept it hidden in the closet, which meant that someone had to come into our house, *not* take 2 xbox 360s, *not* take 3 laptops or 50 dvds or 3 tvs; just his bag of coke.\n\nI played music at a party with my friend next door and my best friend who I'm in a band with.

She said that she only agreed because she forgot what he looked like. He asked her in an email.\n\nAt this point I was still getting along with him (he hadn't yet tried to steal my xbox controller), and she said that she couldn't stand him. She made fun of him for being completely obnoxious. \"Yeah, it was really great how he constantly points out really obvious things and then laughs so loud that everyone looks at him,\" she said. While I could see where she was coming from I actually felt a little bad for him.\n\nAnyway, he didn't do very well with the ladies. He probably wouldn't have been going through my girlfriend's undies if he did.\n\nPS. He is real. Very real.","c096ahz":"i bought both mirrors edge and crysis warhead.

Originally on an xbox, and recently upgraded to a Ubuntu box capable of playing 1080p content.

That shit is ridiculous.  While tempting for the sports I don't feel it's worth it.

It's just unnecessarily difficult to create a perfect product through repeated building\/testing iterations, and this fact would spell the death of any buggy product if not for the fact that increased consumer-producer contact has gotten to the point where each of the players might as well be in the developers' manager's office ten minutes after release. This wasn't possible in 1993, so people would certainly never have considered purchasing a buggy product, but Bethesda has been fixing the problems with their game in relatively short order so it's not as big of an issue.\r\n\r\nThis isn't just true of software. The first generation of xbox 360s are riddled with technical problems (RROD, E74, et al.) but it's much less of a problem with software because software can be patched, but hardware has to be serviced. Technology is just becoming more complicated so it's harder to keep track of everything and make sure it all fits together.\r\n\r\nI agree. The initial releases of Fallout 3 and The Pitt were awful.

I invest 300,- in gaming every 4 years, when I buy a new computer, and 100,- more after 2 years for a new graphics card (Thats $ as well as EUR, since both hardware and software is usually much more expensive in Europe).\n\nThat's 100,- per year for hardware.

The result is that the prices are higher, and there are no bargain deals like on the PC. On PC, a good 2 year old game with good reviews can be bought for $5. Games that sell well for $45 are expected to come with a very good multi year service, including lots of content at no additional costs. On the console, you even have to pay for maps.\n\nI like PCs for many reasons, but the most honest reason why I'm using them is because gaming is dead cheap.

My gaming history has pretty much followed the same pattern. \n\nI've consistently switched back and forth between pc and console gaming throughout the years based on mainly two factors: Price and my perception of what system I could get the most fun out of. \n\nCurrently I'm an avid Xbox 360 gamer, but with current trends in hardware prices I see myself going back to PC gaming fairly soon. \n\nSide note: When I went from PC gaming to playing my first FPS on the Xbox 360 I thought the level of control was fucking retarded compared to a mouse\/keyboard setup. I eventually got used to it and am pretty accurate now and am able to have fun, it became as much second nature as the mouse\/keyboard setup was. \n\nI've been a gamer longer than many of you have been alive. The console hate is unjustified. \n\nI'm currently building a new gaming box getting one piece at a time, but I love my xbox. ","c09mnj7":"Then you should have been around long enough to see the evolution of console games from the intricate, skill-requiring games of the 80s through to the \"stay at it long enough and you'll finish it\" of the late 90s and beyond.\n\nGames on the atari, sms, nintendo and so forth required skill to get to the later levels.  There was a requirement to get significantly better at the game over time, to see the rest.  c.f. anything on the atari from pacman onwards, shoot'em-ups on early consoles like R-Type, and so on.\n\nWith the advent of the ps2 and particularly the xbox, games have featured a lower curve of skill required to complete, where simply investing time will get you through the game.  And once you're done, invest more time unlocking things that are obscure, rather than difficult.  Compare unlocks in games like Mario to ones in GTA.  Not knocking on GTA as it is fun, but once you master the controls, there's little of the game you can't achieve.\n\nPC gaming, being a lot broader, is the only area where such skill improvement is still required by some games (certainly not all) in order to proceed, and gives old gamers like me (and you, in theory) the same thrill that we got to level X because we're *good*, not because we're patient.\n\nAlso, the advent of the FPS and the RTS made mouse\/keyboard the preferred interface.  Nothing else will do for any game of that ilk.\n","c09mnz1":"So, I am playing hl2 recently and really enjoying it. It's running great with no dramas with crossover.

That means you have to configure the wireless router to correctly forward ports, the mac should be set up once you complete the above steps, and then the PS3 will require specific information regarding it's DHCP server (the mac) and the DNS server (the wireless router).\n\nAlso, you have bluetooth?  You could do this whole process over most likely, though with different software processes which I am not intimately familiar with, using the built in Bluetooth in your Mac and PS3.  Simply select Bluetooth as the port you want to share your Macs' internet connection over, rather than ethernet.

Kinda funny to make them ring up everything, take all my information, then walk out and sell it to a guy they were trying to sell to.

Luckily we were able to fix most of them with the 12-cent trick, but others (ana\/hana scaler problems) had to be trashed and\/or returned to Microsoft.  Most of the failures happened on gen 1 hardware though, with gen 2 having a couple issues, and gen 3 almost none.\n\nSo they are definitely working out the kinks with each revision, and of course extending the warranty to e74 etc. is pretty cool.\n\nThe fact that the console had such a high failure rate, yet still beat the playstation is testament to the strength of the platform, as well as the weakness of the PS3.

Unless you are truly platform agnostic.  Xbox provides a much superior experience in terms of online abilities and content, and especially mutliplayer gaming. There is simply no comparison.  However if you don't care much about multiplayer and other benefits of xbox live (you can mute anybody you don't want to hear, quickly, so the whiner argument is nothing but fanboy fud), and you like the (frankly superior) media center capabilities of the PS3, then the ps3 is a viable alternative.  Of course price is a barrier. You could realistically buy 2 - 3 xbox 360s before you get to the entry pricepoint of ps3.","c09pazq":"The old xbox controllers weren't great. They never broke for me but they were ridiculously huge. The 360 controller is on the other hand, one of the nicest controllers I've used..","c09pbp4":"Nah...  PS3 is a great system with plenty of games, at least, compared to xbox360.  It has less good games than Nintendo DS though, which is strange, but in the non-portable market it has a competitive amount of games.\n\nPrice is a big deal.\n\nOne time I went to the store, and I noticed some shooters for a low price.  In particular I saw Dark Sector for 10 bucks.  When Dark Sector came out, I didn't even consider it.  I thought it was garbage.  But for 10 bucks???  Sure, I got it.  I was very surprised and happy that I got it.  I was thinking to myself, \"Wow, this is a good deal.  This game is definitely not worth $60, so I am glad I didn't buy it when it came out.  But it's worth more than $10, that's for sure.  Wow... I got a good bargain here.\"  I was thinking I'd pay $30 bucks for it instead of $10.  Since I usually don't buy discounted games, this was like a huge discovery for me.  I realized that what sucks at one price point, can be very good at a lower price point.\n\nThe same may NOT be true with everything... for example, you may not want to live in a broken down house even for free, but it's true with many things.\n\nI think were Sony to drop the price on PS3, they'd see a massive sales increase.","c09pbzw":"My xbox got RRoD this September.  Microsoft repaired it for free and it worked fine until April in which it RRoD''ed again!  Now Microsoft won't repair the console without me paying an additional $100.

Could you somehow force Microsoft to repair the 360 without the expired warranty fee?","c09pce8":"Right, but I think it's different enough from the older POWER CPUs that you can't really compare them like that.

I love my PS3 (although I also have xbox360, I lean toward the PS3).  Sony just has a bad attitude as a company.

So even if that one example is not the best one, I still think the general complaint is true.","c09pel3":"I own both consoles, and like both but for different reasons. Some things I prefer on the PS3 (bought it originally to be primarily a Blu-ray player), but the biggest gripe I have by FAR, and what frequently leads me to buy games for the Xbox over the PS3 is the PS3's abysmal HD support. I'm sorry, but if the same game is available for both consoles, and it's 1080p on xbox and 720p on PS3, it's not too hard to figure out which one I'm going to buy. Sony really needs to get their act together on this if they want my game library for the PS3 to expand anymore.","c09pem3":"You refuse to run windows and yet own an xbox360 made by the same company...?","c09pfus":"Things break, if your non-warranty toaster breaks, do you go to the consumerist?

For $250 I got a refurbished unit with a 160gb hard drive.  An xbox 360 with that much space costs a lot more.  My son has one and it's a great console but I know from experience it's noisy and takes up a lot of space in an entertainment unit when you factor in the power brick.  They both have their advantages but would I buy a 360 because I wanted to use it for multimedia?  Never.

The rocket launcher does a good amount of damage, has knockback, and the crits are freakin' _deadly_.\n\n* Also give engineer a try: Look around to see where teammates build sentries (it helps to know the map for this). Just having a SG (and dispenser) in a good place will benefit your team greatly (assuming you're defending), and teleporters will help even more.\n\n\nAs for general gameplay tips, I'd say simply follow and observe teammates. Most people know where they're going and what they're doing, and if you're a medic, you can be very hands-on in your observation.\n\nGet a mic and listen to people -- sure, some of the time they will be inane assholes who are similar to the xbox live crowd or will be power-hungry jerkoffs who tell you what to do, but people are generally helpful.\n\nGood luck, and add me on steam for a pickup game or some help!

Xbox 360 still has the smoothest, best-looking version on console and in terms of performance, it's the cheapest way to enjoy a good-looking 720p experience. PlayStation 3 gets close - it's feature-complete (yes, it has Trophies to mirror Achievements), but it's let down a touch by the blurrier graphics. In most cases it manages to look approximate to the 360 game, but there are several shots where it can look pretty poor - the opening shot of Butcher Bay in particular stands out.\r\n\r\nthis tends to be the rule of thumb across multi platform console games.

Dave Shippy is;\r\n\r\n&gt; Shippy was the chief architect of the power processing unit for the Cell, and overall technical leader and architect for the team that created the Power Architecture-related microprocessors that ended up in both the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3\r\n\r\nAnd, [in this recent interview with Gamasutra](http:\/\/www.gamasutra.com\/view\/feature\/3904\/processing_the_truth_an_interview_.php?print=1) he laid Sony's nonsense bare.\r\n\r\n&gt; But can Shippy's insight on both console's processors finally answer the age-old debate about which console is actually more powerful? \r\n\r\n&gt; \"I'm going to have to answer with an 'it depends,'\" laughs Shippy, after a pause. \"Again, they're completely different models. So in the PS3, you've got this Cell chip which has massive parallel processing power, the PowerPC core, multiple SPU cores\u2026 it's got a GPU that is, in the model here, processing more in the Cell chip and less in the GPU. So that's one processing paradigm -- a heterogeneous paradigm.\" \r\n\r\n&gt; \"With the Xbox 360, you've got more of a traditional multi-core system, and you've got three PowerPC cores, each of them having dual threads -- so you've got six threads running there, at least in the CPU. Six threads in Xbox 360, and eight or nine threads in the PS3 -- but then you've got to factor in the GPU,\" Shippy explains. \"The GPU is highly sophisticated in the Xbox 360.\" \r\n\r\n&gt; He concludes: \"At the end of the day, when you put them all together, depending on the software, **I think they're pretty equal**, even though they're completely different processing models.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nENOUGH with this \"PS3 is more powerful than Xbox 360\" garbage.

Then they hyped trash games like Halo and Gears of War to the max, even though the games are free of substance (especially Halo, which is arguable one of the crappiest shooters ever made for many objective and subjective reasons), etc...  This is not the kind of \"excellence\" I want as a consumer.\n\nAnother example of this bad behavior is Nintendo Wii.  It's hyped to the max, but there are no games for it worth playing, and the controllers, which are the center piece of the Wii hype are essentially broken, dead on arrival so to speak.  Now this \"motion plus\" gimmick is promised to fix the problems with insane lag and lack of sensitivity in the Wii controllers.  But still, Wii got no games, but it's the number one sold console on the market.  So financially it's a success.  As a product, from consumer's point of view, it's utter failure.  As something to enjoy, it is a failure.  As something to live for, it is a failure.  It's a failure in a human sense, but a success in some abstract accounting sense.  It's basically a SCAM.

The SIXAXIS controller for the PS3 *added* motion sensing to a controller. The Wiimote was designed from the ground up to be a motion sensing device, I would consider that replacing the standard controller, especially considering that trying to use the Wii setup as a conventional controller is an exercise in futility(try to play any fighting game with a wiimote\/joystick).\n\nPart of why the SIXAXIS failed to contend with the Wii was because it doesn't work to just add motion sensing to a controller in terms of usage. A regular controller like the xbox or the PS2\/3 is capable of doing pretty much everything you could want. The Wii is a novel device that does a lot of the same things, but in a different way. When you have a device that does both the conventional *and* the novel(like the SIXAXIS) you run the risk of ending up with games that struggle to make the most of either.\n\nEitherway, I think we both agree that what really matters is what the developers do with these devices. The Nintendo DS is a perfect example of two competing I\/O formats(touch screen versus buttons) working beautifully on the same device largely due to well designed games(that typically only use either\/or, as opposed to both). \n\n","c09zp82":"Actually Microsoft profits have fallen this year [Source](http:\/\/news.teamxbox.com\/xbox\/19461\/Microsoft-Profit-Falls-for-First-Time-in-23-Years\/), but that admittedly has less to do with piracy and more to do with market saturation and not having a compelling upgrade path for Windows XP users.","c09zplo":"He over-exaggerates, and often gets could in his dreamed up design, rather than facing how the game actually is.\n\n\nHowever, he does deserve tons of credit for many of his previous games.

Listening to many of his interviews, I really want to play the games that are *in his head*.  He often goes into great detail about the subtleties he's trying to convey in his games.  Usually, they don't quite live up, but you can tell he has a wonderful vision.\n\n\nStill, Fable 2 wasn't enough to make me buy an xbox...

GPA is only relevant maybe for your first job out of college, when you probably don't have any experience.

After that (or before?) they took the original free counter-strike, and I believe day of defeat, boxed em and sold em to cash in a bit more. Then they released about 3 or 4, perhaps more, different versions of HL. I think there were actually more than that even thinking about it. I mean, they really appear to have done everything but work on a new game. The one time they did mention making an actual new game, TF2, it got canceled and disappeared into oblivion only to resurface much, much later, look entirely, and on, I assume, a new engine (I have no problem with any of that, just pointing out the original TF2 never really came to be). \n\nIt reminds me of myself as a teenager when my parents would tell me to get a job, I'd do everything in the world to make it look like I was getting a job, find all kinds of excuses why people weren't hiring me, how I could find no good work, do little side jobs here and there to make myself appear busy, but in actuality I wasn't looking, I wasn't doing shit, I didn't wanna work.

It's not meant for hardcore gamers (unless I suppose you buy it as a backup\/secondary xbox as I have), but for people either new to consoles or new to gaming... people that quite frankly won't\/don't really take advantage of the HDD features.

Not as many people have iPhones or xboxen(?).\n\n2. A \"Hook\" - We're hoping that Real Time Flash Multiplayer will that cool new concept about this game that gets people to take a closer look at the game.\n\n3. Resource Ceiling - This is probably the most important concept that I've realized over this project. We are 3 people working on a game in our spare time. With iPhone and XNA, we simply could not compete with the big names when it comes to Art and Code Polish. While it seems a bit backwards, the technical limitations of Flash is comforting. We can reach that top easily and then push the limits from there. Basically comes down to whether we want to have an awesome Flash game or a mediocre XNA\/iPhone game.\n\n\n\nAs for revenue, we're looking at Mochi ads and Flash Game License. Our main goal is to recover any monthly server costs we have. Time spent and start-up costs are acceptable losses for us.

I'm worried I might end up screwing up my car.","c0abb5i":"Call of Cthulhu's sanity system was ok.  I played through the game and nothing really significant happened.  During boss encounters, Jack would commit suicide with a gun or just kneel over and die.  \n\nSometimes you would hear voices and sound effects if you sanity meter was low.  I can't say I experienced objects looking like other objects.  I did make it a point to look at everything in the game. That drops your sanity.\n\nThe negatives of the game were the controls and the health system.  It was difficult to know if I was actually using an object (no crosshair), which lead to me dieing a lot \nmore--renting the room in Innsmouth.  \n\nJack was very fragile and unpredictable in how he got hurt.  If I walked off a four foot cliff, I would be fine half the time.  Every now and then he would break his leg and walk at half speed.  No part of the game can be completed with a broken leg.  It's best to walk into the first Deep One you see.  To beat this game, you have to quick save and restore.  \n\nThe best part of the game was tension.  A lot of the story was pieced together lovecraft stories, and they had memorable parts that were tension filled.  There were several times where I had to stop and ask myself, if I really wanted to see what was waiting for me.  The tension was that great.\n\nThe game had it boring parts.  There were parts where you had to shoot your way through and some parts where you had to sneak.  The shooting parts were hampered by the controls, and the sneaking part was hampered by the sneak system.  You could hide in the same spot over and over and it was random if someone walking by saw you.  I'm not sure if this was to add tension, but it made the game frustrating when combined with your fragile health.  \n\nThere are a few games being made right now.

The watch instantly option via our xbox 360 is a great bonus.","c0abtsn":"Personally, I have heard my gay friends utter, on more than one occasion, \"that's gay.\" When they say it, it's usually ironic. When the average 13 year old says it 2.5 times per minute on xbox live, it's just stupid. It's not necessarily said with malicious intent, but it's neither funny nor relevant.","c0abukb":"man, you can't pull something out of your ass and wrap quotes around it, that's how bullshit spreads!\n\nActual statement:\n\n\"As stated in the Xbox LIVE Terms of Use, a member may not create a gamertag or use text in other profile fields that include comments that look, sound like, stand for, hint at, abbreviate, or insinuate content of a potentially sexual nature.

I got on Live no more than 3 times, used no more than an hour. (Thinking of selling it, if anyone interested, let me know. Spec: its 60gb, rechargeable batter, full subscription for a year to live. Headset included, and a HDMI cable, comes with two games, unopened still, I was about to dump the games in trash lol.) Anyhow, thank god for the PSN, mature crowd!!!!!!!!!!!!WHY, cause the system is expensive and little kids can't afford them unless parents put out some hard cash, its more unlikely. Thank god for PS3 being expensive.\n\n","c0abvt8":"Times are always a-changin'\n\nChild video gamers these days are generally snot-nosed brats. This is because when _you_ were 12 you didn't have xbox live, a headset and parents who used the xbox as a babysitter. Also, when I was 12 video games were total nerd territory, nerds are mostly quiet and shy... the kids playing L4D on xbox live today are _not_ the same nerds, video games are 'cool kid' territory now.\n\n_edit:_ that said, I agree that there's plenty of douchbags of every age.","c0abzhh":"The big difference is with PC gaming you pick where you play.  So I never saw any of that shit even though I played CS, and then DoD obsessively for a few years (6+ hours a day on weekdays, all day on weekends).  Because I chose to play on servers that were run by adults, for adults.  You only play with fucktards if you join a server full of fucktards.  With xbox live you get no say in the matter, so everyone gets stuck playing with fucktards all the time.","c0ac8xb":"Ive got my 23\" HD display on my desk for work.. not far away is a projector directed toward the wall in front of me, it's hooked on the computer (dvi\/vga) and the x360 (hdmi).. so i can either use it (56\" 1280x1024) as a secondary display, either for work or movies\/watever or the xbox...\n\nim in design so the projector for work is not the best.. i would rather have a second 23 incher or bigger but with crispier resolution\/contrast\/calibration options.","c0acaas":"Isn't that kind of old now?\n\nIf you're not stuck on xbox, why not a PS3? I think it has more legs left in it.","c0acadw":"I'm sick of a certain type of trash talk in the lobby (here my experience is almost exclusively with Halo 3).  I don't mind trash talking after the game, particularly if your opponent was being obnoxious beforehand and you delivered an asswhooping.  I don't really mind trashtalking before the game if directed at the other team and about something specific, like if they've played a lot but have very little experience and a low skill level.  One thing I can't stand, however, is being sworn at by a 12 year old on my own goddamn team and for no reason!\r\n\r\nA few months back, I was playing Halo and some kid said \"hey [my gamertag],\" about four or five times until I responded with \"hey\".  His response: \"fuck you, you fucking faggot!  HAAAAA!  HAAAAA!\"  So, I just ignored him without muting him and he kept at it, spewing some really vile, racist weird shit.  I immediately started recording it.  After the game, I went on xbox live and bungie to see what I could find out about him.  In one post, he said that he had three accounts, and I kept digging until I found the name for one of them.  It was a typical first name, like Jason, followed by something I can't remember.  It was pronounceable, however, and I thought it might be his surname.  In a post on his other account, he mentioned living in SoCal, so after some googling, I found some guy with his last name on a business website - he was an engineering consutant.  He was also on the board of some local nonprofit and on that bio, the names of his three kids were mentioned - one was Jason.  I was feeling moderately confident, given what an unusual last name this was, that I'd found the guy.  I sent him a clip of his own vile trashtalk and asked him if he was Jason [last name], son of [Dad's name], with the following address, email address, etc.  I mentioned that his dad might be interested in a certain file I have, including his dear son's voice saying some untoward things to a total stranger.  He didn't respond for two days, so I figured I was wrong - I bluffed and didn't have anything on this kid.\r\n\r\nThen, I got the most long-winded, contrite, apologetic and clearly nervous message from him.  He offered to play my account and boost it to a certain skill level, or to pay someone else to do it, to pay for my xbox gold membership for a year, etc.  \r\n\r\nIt was quite satisfying.","c0acbbe":"THIS!!!!! I cannot upvote you enough for this. I came here to say the same thing.\n\nAlso... Pac-Man Championship Edition is perhaps the single best game on xbox live.\n\nAlso also, if you want a new game, make it Red Faction Guerrilla, holy crap that game is fun.","c0acciu":"The nice thing about the PC is that I can use the wiimote as a mouse \/ controller for playing media files and even enough to browse the internet basically.

Combine it with my old xbox running xbmc for now and Later upgrade it to an Apple TV running xbmc and just stream all my media from this fileserver.  I would likely keep it on all of the time, so it should be able to do double duty with standard linux utils (sorry windows guys, but having a box with a command line around is too handy).\n\nI was thinking of trying to do something with OpenSolaris and ZFS, but the more I dig into it I've noticed there are other products that support ZFS, such as FreeBSD and I think some of the testing versions of FreeNAS do as well. Though I'm not sure how well.\n\nSpeaking of FreeNAS, it looks like it's a very stripped down version of FreeBSD, does that mean most of the libs and such are gone that would make it a good general purpose server e.g. running torrents, irc client and the like?","c0acki7":"Get him an original XBOX($60-90), install a modchip($20-50) or softmod(free) it and torrent a shitload of xbox exclusive games rated higher than 80% on metacritic.

It's a lot more fun slamming at a console on the bigscreen with surround sound than nerdly pushing around a PC.\n\nI was completely fucking blown away. I had never seen that quality of graphics on my on-paper-much-better PC rig, nor did I enjoy the sound or the ease of use of the controllers, and so on.\n\nAnd yeah, when GTA4 came out on the PC, finally (not all that many games appear there anymore) I grabbed it, and was shocked to find it played worse than on the almost-four-year-old 360.\n\nAgain, the 360 is almost four years old. And here you are grunting about some next generation nvidia cards. Yeah, well if a current PC can barely keep up with a targeted console from four years ago, imagine what the xbox 720 or whatever will be like...\n\nSo save the tired shit about how far behind consoles are because it sounds like you're a ridiculous PC fanboy. I'm just some asshole who likes to game occasionally, and who was shocked at how much power a little console brings (plus ease of use, etc)\n\n&gt;There is also the fact you can build a gaming PC roughly the size of a console, have HDMI out\n\nOr you can spend $179 and buy an xbox 360.\n","c0adam4":"I had this same problem.

No more charges after that, i guess they wait till you dispute a charge then stop.  I wonder how many people get charged year after year for this even though they aren't using it if they just dont notice the charge on thier card.

Thousands of computers world wide join together to one 'super-computer'. The trick is, that unused computing time in home computers or even game consoles gets used as they aren't really used to their capacities nowadays. This project here - folding at home - was brought to life by the Stanford University in California. It uses the computational power of thousands of computers to research the so called 'folding of proteins'. This way, numerous deseases like alzheimers, parkinson or cancer could possibly be cured in the near future. And also scientists in Karlsruhe get supported by worldwide power. (movieclip starts)\r\n\r\nKarlsruhe - the biggest scientific data processing center in Europe. A part of the gigantic amount of data of the 'CERN', the nuclear research center in Geneva, gets processed here. Hundreds of computers work on one single project. Dr. Wolfgang Wenzel of the research departement Karlsruhe tries to go another way: to research and fight deseases, he and his team use distributed computing over the internet. There project peom@home calculates the folding of proteins. Voluntary donors of computional power may participate from there homes.\r\n\r\nDr.Wolfgang Wenzel speaking: \"The poem@home project we brought to live runs for a year and a half now. There are more than 30.000 people in more than 100 countries worldwide who allocate computational power of 10.000 state of the art, meaning 'normal' pcs, every day. If you convert that value, that poem@home gives us with voluntary performance of poeple who provide there unused resources, you may move things, you couldn't do as a single person or even with public research funds.\" [I'm sorry but it didn't make much more sense in german...]\r\n\r\nTo give Dr. Wenzels Team even more computational power, they work to port there projects to the playstaion 3. Sonys graphical'bolide' is, thanks to linux, suited excellently for scientific calculations.\r\n\r\nWenzel: \"The Playstation 3 got the cell processor, the xbox got an own, powerfull graphics processor, both give the output of about 250 pcs within in the amount of money. So if I may calulate my algorithm on that platform, I get 250 more performance for the same amount of money and even those processes maybe distributed worldwide (in\/on\/to??) the grid.\"\r\n\r\nUwe Beckert also uses the processing power of the playstation 3 for a good purpose. He started as a user of distributed computing but today, he develops projects himself in which others may participate with there pc or gaming console. Uwe Beckert works on using computational power of graphics boards for projects. Those should breach known speed records in distributed computing.\r\n\r\nUwe Beckert: \"A graphics board is optimized to do a lot in parallel. Maybe not one step really fast but a lot of them in parallel. And that's how graphics boards today have got the possibility to 'take 256 or more actions in parallel' [I think he wants to say calculate processes in parallel or something] and I am not able to do this on a quadcore processor. So if I am able optimize it for a graphics board and convert it to parallelize it, which is a completely different programming paradigm, the performance will increase factor by 10 or 100.\"\r\n\r\nWith that technology some grid networks will be as fast as or even faster than some super computers. And that's one of the reasons why some people install free grid software to donate ther processing power voluntaryly worldwide.\r\n\r\nUwe Becker: \"On the one hand, there are people saying 'we want to support those projects because they do something against cancer or climate modeling or something like that. And also there's this 'gamer thought' because there's a pointing system where you can join together to teams and compete others.\"\r\n\r\nThose points aren't worth anything and you can't buy anything of them. You only may feel good. Distributed computing still depends on voluntary help from people all over the world. A lot of deaseas could be explored in the near future - thanks to the internet.\"","c0agjje":"What ezekial was describing (in terms of what he wanted) nearly perfectly described the functionality of the xbox 360.","c0aglky":"If it was xbox the quote would have been filled with racial slurs and gay hate.","c0agqr3":"if they're developing it for windows it really is a small technical hurdle to port it to the xbox.

First of all Nintendo TRIED to do that (Beginning with the NES,  which had a lockout chip, the 10NES, that disallowed unlicensed games)   Several companies reverse engineered the chip and went about making their own games without the nintendo stamp on it.   They tried to tell them they couldn't do it,  but well,  it didn't stand up in nintendos favor.    The problem with the applications setup they're using is that they disallow all external apps unless you jail break your phone.   This is effectively a monopoly.   I love how you'd LIKE to support the idea that monopolies are legal...alas they are not,   all it will take is one good set of pissed off devs and some good lawyers to fix that.     \n\nThe simplest definition of monopoly is many buyers one supplier.   That is effectively what apple is doing here and I'm sure it'd not sit well in court if it ever reached a judge.   As for the developers.   It is not considered a normal risk,  designing an application, spending years developing it,  only to be told by the only supplier of your clients that they don't feel like selling your piece of software.    Sure they cite several \"rules\" that weren't adhered to,  unfortunately there are many many pieces of software currently in the app store that violate the very same rules.  You cannot pick and choose and you cannot (in the united states)  run a monopoly.    Albeit the monopoly only effects a small group,  the reason it would be held high in court is because it effects every single owner of an iphone as well as every single developer who may wish to write an app.    \n\n&gt;Maybe if these douchebags had actually sat down and wrote a business case before \"secretly\" coding something, they would have realized that Apple is trying to make money by selling games, and an app which lets you play games for free through an emulator won't exactly jive with their philosophy.\n\nYour argument that the emulation format would cost them money (by allowing users to play games) is interesting.   Consider this,  the emulator sells on the market place, just as the games do,  thus it also makes apple money.   I assume you're arguing that it allows many games to be played,  well yes,  except they're all circa 1980 something,  and not all that great,  its more of a \"hey that's cool\" factor really.  I find it silly that you argue that apple is trying to make money,  which they do by SELLING APPS THAT DEVELOPERS MAKE (protip: just like this)   \n\nBut lets go back to the initial statement you made about nintendo, xbox, etc.   The thing is,  the iphone doesn't have a chip that locks out unlicensed software,  they just have a little bit of software that keeps users from providing their own software, thus reducing the market to apple provided third party wares.   I suggest you take a nice sack lunch down to your local law library and do a little delving into how monopoly law applies in case law to micro-monopolies,  you'll find you have no legs to stand on.","c0ah75u":"I remember using some glitch on the xbox version (i think it had something to do with equipping and unequipped powerful weapons) I managed to fly super fast indefinitely. the problem was that while i could travel anywhere super fast the game took FOREVER to load the next area thus the vast majority of time spent playing was waiting for the game to load.","c0ah788":"My biggest problems are that I have to pause downloading when I want to use other internet things, like reddit or xbox live.

Your post didn't have enough content to tell definitively either way, which is why I didn't press it further.  It just sounded like the standard complaints from PC games about how consoles suck, and the major difference, as I see it, is in their input devices. That hating an input method is nitpicky was largely my point.\n\n&gt;However, when people tell me that 'if they could hook their xbox up to my pc, they would equal or best my mouse-skills with an analogue stick', I laugh and tell them to not be so fucking retarded.\n\nAgreed here.  I've been playing consoles games for a long time, and when I was a heavy PC gamer, I didn't play many FPSs.  Probably mostly because of this, movement with WASD, and changing the camera with the mouse is less natural than with the analog sticks, and jumping with Space is downright awkward.  However,  for any game where you have to aim a gun, the mouse is much better because it is so much more precise.\n\nThe XBOX 360 controller is good enough, but I have no delusions about being able to take on someone with a mouse and keyboard.  (Of course it doesn't help that I suck at FPS, and would probably still get my ass kicked if I had a mouse\/keyboard and everyone else had a controller.)","c0aidhn":"I could never get past the first few levels.

HORI is pretty much the best reputable brand you'll find stateside without getting a custom stick.

Going back some religions at times basically expected one of your sons to be 'given' to the service of the church.\n\nThe fact that you even think of religion in terms of \"services rendered\" is a rather strange to me. Sure, I get that religions have traditionaly required tithing. Though many modern Christian sects are not quite so explicit. You usually give what you can\/want. And generally you're giving to the local church and not some international organization (with the exception of Catholicism, of course). So you can see exactly where your money is going. It is really is more of a donation than a purchase. A Buddhist Temple I used to visit in Chicago had a jar for donations and next to it a list of the specific repairs and such that your money was going towards. There was no corporate structure build around it, despite Buddhism being a particularly large religion. \n\nScientology, on the other hand, has quite an extensive corporate-like structure. It is a farce of a religion. Not to mention its rather malevolent legal arm....\n\n&gt; No, Walmart is not a comparison. Scientology offers help on a best efforts basis. It's up to the parishioner to use it for their benefit\n\nRight, just like when you buy something at Walmart, it is up to you to apply the purchased object for your benefit. This is basic free market economics. How is this NOT like what the Church of Scientology is selling?\n\n&gt; No one can change you except yourself.\n\nAnd Walmart can't make you use their products effectively. \n\n&gt; No result is promised;\n\nSame with Walmart.\n\n&gt; You donate for a service. \n\nYou purchase a service.  A donation would imply that there is an option to no pay. For exampe, if you couldn't afford it. Go to any Org. They have prices listed for each service and materials. It may be called a dontion for tax purposes, but for all other intents and purposes, it most certinaly is a **purchase**. \n\n&gt; If someone can't comprehend that they made a donation and that they received the service donated for, then they can have their donation back (name another church that returns donations...) but sorry no more services.\n\nI don't know about giving you money back, but I know many churches that would still allow someone to attend church free of charge, particularly if they couldn't afford it. You can't put a price of spirituality... unless you're Scientology. \n\n&gt; Try buying and playing an xbox from Walmart and then returning it because you didn't enjoy it, and then try to buy back another new xbox right then and there.\n\nWhy would you buy another Xbox if yu didn't enjoy it. If you bought a new one, presumably the old one was defenctive. In which case, you often **can** do exactly what you say.\n\n&gt; Sucks that money and religion have to mix.\n\nThey dont' have to mix in the way Scientology does it. \n\n&gt; But would you rather your government just gave the church prime land to use? \n\nIrrelevent. Churches today get buy just fine on voluntary donations.\n\n&gt; That's what the Catholic church got back in the day. And frankly they appear to be selling that land slowly as finances get tough. Not to pick on them, but that is my understanding anyway.\n\nThe Catholic Church has historically had a destructive influence on society. And part of it was exactly because they started to put a price on salvation and specific services rendered. Just like Scientology is doing now.  The only reason Scientology isn't the kind of destructive force that the Catholic church is because it is so small. There's every reason to believe that if Scientology were to grow to the size of the Catholic Church, it would certainly be a force of great destruction and exploitation. \n \nBottom line: you can't put a price on spirituality.  Once you do, you are hopelessly corrupted. And that's where Scientology is now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","c0aip8q":"[Space Giraffe](http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/games\/s\/spacegiraffexboxlivearcade\/default.htm)","c0aiues":"Rez HD (xbox live marketplace) is a stoner game, period.

They haven't exactly lived up to either so far.\n\nIt's even more irritating noting that Valve has forged a winning strategy with TF2: take the time to get the fundamentals of the game down good at release; then build the userbase with regular free content additions; each released with a sale and a healthy dosage of marketing.  It's an excellent strategy, and shows that Valve not only understands that games don't just disappear after six months (or whenever the publisher decides to stop paying for patches), but has some idea use this strange phenomenon of 'loyal fan bases'.  Keeping the game regularly updated helps keep people playing, which in turn encourages new players to buy and play the game, which in turns helps keep people who do own the game playing.  The flood of purchases after every DLC is probably more than enough to fund their development, which means everybody wins.\n\nAt this random moment, TF2 has a quarter peak players compared to CS:S and a third peak players compared to CS.  Given the regular free packs and the relative beginner friendliness of TF2, I think TF2's player base could easily challenge both CS and CS:S in the long run.  Considering that franchise's peak popularity and staying power, this is not a small accomplishment.\n\nL4D, at least the first one, is never get this chance.

A single development environment to write games for PC, XBOX1, XBOX360, Zune, and no doubt any future platforms such as nextbox, and ZuneHD.","c0amnf4":"use your argument for the xbox as well, and basically you have a curve of graphical ability that climbs with the age of the console, levelling out towards the end of their lifecycles as developers give up investing money in imrpovements. Yes, we get nicer looking ps3 games, but nicer looking xbox360 games too, and if the past 4 years anything to go by the ps3 will come off looking worse. \r\n\r\nso yes, ps3 has a handful of games that look real nice. But that's the problem, it is just a couple. 90% of cross-platform games, whether developed on ps3 primarily or not look worse on the platform, and every game is having problems meeting sales targets.. even triple-a games like lbp.\r\n\r\nThe real problem for sony is that whilst the console can push out some real amazing graphics, only a handful of sonys on development studios can be bothered to invest the time, especially when developing for both the wii and 360 is relatively easy, which is why you see some developers refusing to even work with the platform themselves (valve).","c0amnz8":"I'll second this.

He was just your typical script kiddie until a very skilled and advanced black hat hacker named BlackBart (not his real name either) took a liking to him.  BlackBart gave BillTheHacker a copy of one of his most powerful viruses and a recipe to grow it even stronger.. basically he burned a copy of the virus to a DVD disc and then put it into a DVD Player.  He played the virus over and over so that it would grow stronger and stronger.  But then BillTheHacker had a crazy idea, he used the remote control for the DVD player to fast-forward the virus.  This actually allowed the virus to run past real-time and into the future, over and over, getting further and further into the future while it got stronger and stronger.  He now believes that his virus is the strongest in the world (but in the future) and he's the most powerful hacker ever (but also in the future).   With BillTheHacker's future powers assured, he sits back playing xbox now just biding his time until he and his future virus will rule the nets.\n\n","c0ao0js":"XNA is the best I've found.\r\n\r\nruns on XP, Vista &amp; xbox 360.

There are tons of tutorials on pretty much anything you could need. Plus, if you ever decide to, you can pay $99\/mo(EDIT: year not month) (or 12 months free if you're a student) and upload the games to an xbox360 to play them on. The XNA framework allows for most of the code in a game to be the same regardless of platform (I just starting writing a 3D RPG for 360, and the code I have so far only has 1 or 2 differences between the 360 version and the PC version - and you can keep only 1 version of the code with some simple #if XBOX360 statements).\n\nXNA is going to be much more powerful than pygame (I know you said it was just a simple 2D game, but you never know when you're going to want better graphics), since it's basically just a wrapper for DirectX with all the graphics-pipeline-specific stuff abstracted a little bit to make it easier to work with.\n\nplus, you can download visual c# express 2008 which is a very good IDE that will speed up your coding immensely.\n\nIf you're thinking about including multiplayer, I actually found XNA to be easier to work with than pygame (I did pygame networking a few months ago, and XNA networking about a year ago and I remember doing it through XNA to be more straightforward, but I'm sure that opinion is anti-shared by a lot of people) ","c0ao6gi":"My advice is to find one solution that you are productive with and don't sweat the low-level platform specific details until you have made something that warrants the extra effort.

So I get back after being away for a month and desperately dive for my xbox (4 weeks with no Halo is a long time).\n\nI pop in a disk and get a read error. I try another...same thing. Now this seems odd as my xbox worked perfectly before I left.I go out to the main menu, and yep, all of my saves are there...except, no music. I had copied a linkin park cd to the hdd so I could play it at extreme volumes to wake up my former roommate. \n\nThis is when I look at the top of my xbox...it's not engraved. What my roommate didn't know was that me and a friend of mine had found an engraving tool, and had proceded to carve our names into everything  that we owned. I check my roommates xbox, and there it is on top \"BONES\". \n\nSo I did what any rational person would do, I deleted **everything** of of both xboxes (including my roommates oblivion save, 99% Vice city save, etc). I found the memory card he used to do the transfer, and deleted everything on it too. I then never spoke of it again, and neither did he. \n\n**TL:DR** Army roommate tried to swap his broken xbox for mine.

It was great fun and I'm looking forward to visiting them in a few weeks (we go to different schools and have different schedules; it's complicated).\n\nAlso, my roommate during my first school term was a great guy as well, although he was a clean freak while I was sort of messy, but this was ok because we had suites separated by a door. Also, we both thoroughly enjoyed chicken wings.","c0apcvc":"I POSTED MINE A WHILE AGO, [HERE.](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/politics\/comments\/8fxxt\/study_shows_conservatives_dont_know_that_colbert\/c095q7l)\n\nARTICLE TITLE: Study shows conservatives don't know that Colbert is joking.\n\nCOPYPASTA:\n\n\"I lived with a kid last year who loved Colbert and hated Jon Stewart. When I told him that his show and his character were satire, he cited the speech that Colbert gave at that dinner as proof that he was actually conservative.\n\nIf there was ever a person whose existance was a complete waste of oxygen, it was this kid. By the second week of the semester, he was claiming that my xbox controller--which I had let him use--was actually his. A few days later he told me that his father had called and told him that he left his controller at home, so I was right. A few days later, after being a douchebag to me, I told him to give me the controller back. He kept being a douchebag until I got in his face, at which point he tried to brush it off saying, \"Haha, man, I was just fucking around, chill out.\" When he realized that I still wanted the controller back, he suggested we go outside. He was about 6'3\", 175 pounds. I'm 5'6\", 110 pounds. I suggested that he \"stop being a cunt and just give my controller back.\" About a minute later he did.\n\nHe used to scream \"motherfucker\" at the top of his lungs outside on our porch (time of day made no difference) while smashing our Welcome mat on the railing if the Giants lost.\n\nI caught him going through the drawer in my room where my girlfriend kept some of her underwear.\n\nHe argued that Phish was the greatest band to ever exist, and that every member of Phish was the greatest player of their respective instruments (Trey-best guitarist ever, Mike-best bassist, ever). During this argument, he said that Phish has sold more albums (live, bootleg, studio, etc) than any other band, ever. When I showed him [this page](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_best-selling_music_artists), he laughed and quoted the line \"the sales-figures within articles published by reliable sources may not be 100 percent accurate,\" as if this meant that Phish--a band that's not even on the list--was in fact at the top of the list. He tried to give me a music history lesson, saying that \"you have five basic genres that music evolved from: classical, jazz, the blues, rock, and country.\" (If you know anything about the history of music, this is hilarious. If you don't, it's the equivalent of saying \"There are 3 basic sciences: sociology, psychology, and math.\") When told that there was no single greatest musician or band--because that is a matter of opinion--he said that some opinions could be wrong and some could be right.\n\nHe went halves with a friend of mine on an oz. of cocaine. It was fronted to them but they were going to sell it and each pay for their own half. One weekend, when my friend was at his parents', my roommate did all of his half with some slutty girl and her boyfriend on our kitchen table. When my friend came back, my roomate told him that someone had broken into our house and stolen it, so he wasn't going to be able to pay for his half and he expected my friend to pay. My friend told me about this the next day, and I told him that not only was I there when he did it, he kept it hidden in the closet, which meant that someone had to come into our house, *not* take 2 xbox 360s, *not* take 3 laptops or 50 dvds or 3 tvs; just his bag of coke.\n\nI played music at a party with my friend next door and my best friend who I'm in a band with. He yelled for five minutes straight \"more dissonant chords!\" at my best friend while we were playing.\n\nMy other roommate did the dishes once every few weeks because this douchebag would leave a dirty pile in the sink, and we'd run out of dishes. I brought one bowl, one fork, and one glass, and used them for every meal. When I moved out, my other roommate had just cleaned the dishes. The douchebag must have stayed for an extra week or so, because we all got charged $100 out of our security deposit. Someone had left the sink full of dirty dishes and they had to replace them.\n\nI went home for a weekend, and so did my cool roommate. The douchebag peed in the toilet upstairs and didn't flush the toilet. After the first few months he stopped sleeping in his room (upstairs) and would sleep on the couch in the living room (downstairs). That weekend, I assume he never went upstairs again, because when I came home the entire second floor reaked of piss which had been left sitting in the open toilet for days.\n\nHe said that global warming wasn't real, because \"at this time last year I was wearing shorts, but it's still cold this year!\"\n\nOne morning I woke up to him laughing hysterically. He was watching a Larry the Cable Guy stand up special.\n\nHe was from West Philadelphia--born and raised. Just kidding, he was from New Jersey.\n\nHoly shit. Sorry.

I think the 80s were a perfect period for that kind of books, the popular culture was much different than the modern one. What have we done? What has society done? Hipsters and xbox kids hate on pretty much everything that in some way changed our world. Kids nowadays have no interest in science fiction that doesn't feature laser cannons or evil violent aliens, that's one of the reasons for which the cyberpunk genre died. Maybe it's better like that, as I don't want to see punks hacking Facebook or shit like that.","c0atr09":"Well its not doing stellar, and the PS2 really set the benchmark for console gaming quality so its a tough act to follow.

Electronics will always die, but the Wii and ps3 are solid units that were not prematurely released. They will both last well into the future because they were built for the long-term.

He was a big Halo player for the original XBox, and he had a hard time believing my position, that a keyboard + mouse was a more accurate control scheme for aiming.\n\n\"Why is it more accurate?\" you may ask. It's simple. When using the joystick, you're essentially applying forces to the in-game \"cursor.\" When you aim with the joystick, you're not directly positioning your cross hair to where you want it, but telling it to move in a particular direction for as long as you hold that direction on the joystick. When you let go, your cross hair stops moving. Your brain needs to predict the position of the cross hair given the speed and time of the joystick movement. \n\nWith a mouse (depending on your acceleration option, of course), there is a direct 1-1 correspondence between the position on your mousepad and the position of the cross hair on the screen. This may be difficult at first, but once muscle memory kicks in you end up being more accurate. This is due to the fact that your brain remembers the position of the mouse needed to turn around X degrees, rather than attempting to predict the time + speed needed to reach X degrees. In other words, when using a mouse, your brain can take time out of the equation.\n\nAs far as anecdotal evidence, I have found that the maximum speed you can move the cross hair across the screen using a controller is much lower than the maximum speed a human can move a mouse. Obviously I'm a PC gamer who plays TF2. I couldn't even imagine attempting to rocket jump and immediately aim for my next target using an xbox controller!\n\nIn short, I would find a way to use your mouse. If you need to up your sensitivity a bunch (which you should be able to do with your G5) it's well worth it. Once you get used to it I think you won't even notice the small space.","c0au9ht":"Is that good for one player on an xbox or is it better for multiple people on one xbox?","c0aubmc":"Im very glad you asked.\r\n\r\nWell...\r\n\r\nThe ps2 had one 294 MHz cpu and a 150mhz co-processor. These were custom made and i think they are ARM based... (It was a in-order RISC chip). It also had 32mb of ram.\r\n\r\nThe Xbox had a 733 MHz stripped down Pentium 3 chip in it and 64 mb of totally different ram.\r\n\r\nThe GameCube had a 485 MHz power pc chip (basically what is in the wii as you said) and it had 43mb of ram.\r\n\r\nNow these are quite different machines one Arm based with 2 cpus, one average power but high clock speed and easy to use Intel cpu, and then on PowerPC 750 based cpu.\r\n\r\nAnd you have 32, 43, and 64 mb of ram.\r\n\r\nAlso the xbox had a very different architecture because it only had 1 memory bank, for the games graphics, audio, and OS to reside in.\r\n\r\nThe ps2 had more than 1 part for audio etc... Also Sony reserved 5-7 mb too so if only really had 25 mb.\r\n\r\nAnd the main reason that it was \"easy\" to make multiplatform games is not so much that they were in anyway the same, but that they used much smaller teams for all these consoles. Also companies would hire other smaller companies to do ports whilst the first was working on the main version, this is usually to expensive and doesn\u2019t work as good now with the size of games.\r\n\r\nNow the Xbox 360 is not just a more awesome PC for 3 main reasons, first it uses the power pc architecture which is what Apples computers used to use. Second is that an xbox has just 512 meg of ram for use by everything, everything can get stuff from it and put stuff in it too, audio, graphics card, OS, network stuff, everything where as a pc has graphics ram, and system ram separately. \r\n\r\nSo anyway they are all very different machines and anyways have been, the closest they ever came to being like a pc was the original Xbox, but they have gone way away from that path now...\r\n\r\nEverything else you said was quite accurate and you do seem to know a lot more about this kind of thing than the average person.\r\n","c0aud2i":"I got an original xbox for xmas 2007 and never really played it or got into it as much as my 360 I got last christams time.

Gears of war2 is excellent for xbox and killzone 2 is superb for ps3. I would suggest picking up overlord 2 and prototype for the system of your choice. \n\nBoth systems have some killer games coming out as well. I am sure you will be happy with either system. Tales of vesperia is actually being released on xbox so you can take that into consideration as well as mass effect 2. ps3 also has some nice integration with the psp and uncharted 2 won best in show from gamespot for e3 this year.\n\nI would recommend picking up Overlord 2, prototype and Fallout 3 for whichever system you decide to get.\n\n","c0awba7":"Psshhh, I've got it on my old xbox :-).   xbmc.org","c0awbat":"The one thing I've found most useful on the PS3 is that I can put movies on a USB stick and watch movies\/tv shows on a TV screen as opposed to a computer monitor.

Sony has also said they wouldnt be lowering the price at all. Now the way I see it, without call of dutys, guitar heros or movie games the ps3 is dying worse than it already is. How much longer do you think it will take before EA copies Activision and quits too. Then the gap in the libraries is too large to warrent anyone purchasing a ps3 or developing for it.

Let's discuss a few things before you fumble with swapping the unused ski rack for the unused bike rack on the Subaru. \n\nSo yes, you've noticed the sun is out, and hey!- maybe it would be cool to to some bike riding. Let's keep in mind that the sun came out of all 600,000 of us, so for the most part, you're not the only one who noticed. Please remember that when you walk into my shop on a bright, sunny Saturday morning. It will save you from looking like a complete twat that huffs \"Why are there so many people here?\" \n\nAre we all on the same page now about it being sunny outside? Have we all figured out that we're not the only clever people that feel sunny days are good for bike riding? Great. I want to kiss all of you on your forehead for sharing this moment with me. Put your vitamin D starved fingers in mine, and we'll move on together to some pointers that will make life easier. \n\nSOME POINTERS FOR THE PHONE: \n\n- I don't know what size of bike you need. The only thing that I can tell over the phone is that you sound fat. I don't care how tall you are. I don't care how long your inseam is. Don't complain to me that you don't want to come ALL THE WAY down to the bike shop to get fitted for a bike. I have two hundred bikes in my inventory. I will find one that fits you. Whether you come from the north or the south, my shop is downhill. Pretend you're going to smell a fart, ball up, and roll your fat ass down here. \n\n- Don't get high and call me. Write it down, call me later. When I have four phone lines ringing, and a herdlet \nof people waiting for help, I can't deal with you sitting there \"uuuuhhh\"-ing and \"uuummm\"-ing while your brain tries to put together some cheeto-xbox-fixie conundrum. We didn't get disconnected, I left you on hold to figure your shit out. \n\n-I really do need to see your bike to know what is wrong with it. You've already figured out that when you car makes a noise, the mechanic needs to see it. When your TV goes blank, a technician needs to see it. I can tell you, if there is one thing I've learned from you fucking squirrels, it's that \"doesn't shift right\" means your bike could need a slight cable adjustment, or you might just need to stop backing into it with the Subaru. Bring it in, I'll let you know for sure. \n\n- No, I don't know how much a good bike costs. For some, spending $500 dollars is a kingly sum. For others, $500 won't buy you one good wheel. You really need to have an idea of what you want, because every one of you raccoons \"doesn't want to spend too much\". \n\nFOR YOU INVENTIVE TYPES AND DO-IT-YOURSELFERS: \n\n- Just because you think is should exist, doesn't mean that it does. I know that to you, a 14 inch quill stem makes perfect sense, but what makes more sense is buying a bike that fits you, not trying to make your mountain bike that was too small for you to begin with into a comfort bike. \n\n- If some twat on some message board somewhere says that you can use the lockring from your bottom bracket as a lockring for a fixie conversion doesn't mean that A: you can, or B: you should. Please listen to me on this stuff, I really do have your best interests at heart. \n\n- I love that you have the enthusiasm to build yourself a recumbent in the off season. That does not mean however, that I share your enthusiasm; ergo I won't do the \"final tweaks\" for you. You figure out why that Sram shifter and that Shimano rear derailleur don't work together. While we're at it, you recumbent people scare me a little. Don't bring that lumbering fucking thing anywhere near me. \n\nA DEDICATION TO ALL THE HIPSTER DUCHEBAGS: \n\n-If you shitheads had any money, you wouldn't NEED a vintage Poo-zhow to get laid. Go have an ironic mustache growing contest in front of American Apparel, so that I can continue selling $300 bikes to fatties, which is what keeps the lights on. \n\n- Being made in the 80's may make something cool, but that doesn't automatically make something good. The reason that no one has ridden that \"vintage\" Murray is because it's shit. It was shit in the 80's, a trend it carried proudly through the 90's, and rallied with into the '00's. What I mean to say is, no, I can't make it work better. It's still shit, even with more air in the tires. \n\nSO YOU'RE GONNA BUY A BIKE: \n\nGood for you! Biking is awesome. It's easy, it's fun, it's good for you. I want you to bike, I really do. To that end, I am here to help you. \n\n-Your co-worker that's \"really into biking\" knows fuck all. Stop asking for his advice. He could care less about you having the right bike. He wants to validate his bike purchase(s) through you. He also wants to sleep with you, and wear matching bike shorts with you. \n\n- You're not a triathlete. You're not. If you were, you wouldn't be here, and we both know it. \n\n- You're not a racer. If you were, I'd know you already, and you wouldn't be here, and we both know it. \n\n- So you want a bike that you can ride to work, goes really fast, is good for that triathlon you're doing this summer (snicker), is good on trails and mud, and costs less than $300. Yeah. Listen, I want a car that can go 200 miles an hour, tow a boat, has room for five adults, is easy to parallel park but can carry plywood, gets 60mpg, and only costs $3,000. I also want a unicorn to blow me. What are we even talking about here? Oh yeah. Listen, bikes can be fast, light, cheap and comfortable. Pick two, and we're all good. \n\nABOUT YOUR KIDS: \n\nYour kids are amazing. Sure are. No one else has kids as smart, able, funny or as good looking as you. Nope. Never see THAT around here. \n\n- I have no idea how long you kid will be able to use this bike. As it seems to me, your precious is a little retarded, and can't even use the damn thing now. More likely, your budding genius is going to leave the bike in the driveway where you will Subaru the bike to death LONG before the nose picker outgrows the bike. \n\n- Stop being so jumpy. I am not a molester. You people REALLY watch too much TV. When I hold the back of the bike while your kid is on it, it's not because I get a thrill from *almost* having my hand on kid butt, it's because kids are unpredictable, and generally take off whenever possible, usually not in the direction you think they might go. Listen, if I were going to do anything bad to your kids, I'd feed them to sharks, because sharks are FUCKING AWESOME. \n\n\nI hope this helps, and have fun this summer riding your kick-ass bike! \n\nLocation: Seattle\nit's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests","c0awrhb":"&gt; If you're mainly interested in RPG titles (like myself), then the Xbox 360 is almost undeniably the way to go.

Can you give me some examples of RPG titles exclusive to the xbox?\n\nAlso do correct me if I'm wrong, but the xbox requires the monthly (or yearly or what have you) fee for internet play (xbox live) but the PS3 does not.

But for the Xbox 360, we've spent a lot of thought and a lot of time in playing around with the controller and finding ways to give the same level of control in the way that you throttle, in the way that you turn and move, use your jump jets, and everything that gives you that MechWarrior experience that doesn't turn it into a power-up pickup sort of arcade style game.\n\ndoesn't sound like they wanna dumb it down to xboxesque \"push x to do everything\"\n\n\n[edit] even better:\n\n&gt;Yeah, if you look at the 360 controller, I think that if we empower the player to assign functionality to what is frankly an intimidating number of buttons on that controller, there's a lot of options that we can offer the player in terms of how to chain weapons, assign coolant or other components of the information warrior part to different parts on the controller as well as making the controller modal if we need to. I think the key thing is having a ramp where a more casual player isn't overwhelmed with the control surfaces and unable to have a great time playing this thing. It's really got to go from arcade level controls to simulation level controls in an elegant unfolding of functionality. When people start, they need an entry point to be successful and have a great time without needing to have memorized lots of different controls, but you need to have it unfold for advanced players who want to micromanage. \n\n*&lt;starts a more expressive kind of happy dance&gt;*\n","c0axy8g":"I actually go to Embry-Riddle (big pilot\/engineer\/ATC school) and have a ton of ATC friends.

While this is out of reach for individuals.  Any small business could really get a loan to purchase one of these.  I am curious to see how difficult the process is.  Could I just place in any object that I want duplicated (lets say the face of my xbox 360 which I broke) and it would create an identical one in plastic?  I heard about these machines awhile back on Discovery Channel, at that time I think they were about $100,000.  So I can see this happening in the next 5-10 years at the individual level.  If it does, I will be an early adopter.","c0ay2o2":"I am pretty sure that the achievements are stored on the xbox live servers, so as long as you are connected to xbox live when you get the achievements, they should follow you around when you switch xboxes","c0ay4y7":"As mentioned by others here, recovering your account to a different console is a fairly common &amp; easy thing to do.

I'm smiling at my credit card statement and the interest rate is just magically returning to where it would be if credit card company interests weren't represented in Congress and the Senate, leading 43% of American families to spend more than they make each year and raising the average American debt level to 129% of disposable income. Later, when I go and play my xbox (it makes me happy!), imperial military expansionism in order to support a bloated and unsupportable economy will simple wash away and be replaced by a defense-oriented military and economy based on healthy growth instead of rapid and unsustainable growth. ","c0ay7iu":"among some of the really good posts already before me, i believe we are smarter than our parents. therefore, we all have more competition for the resources in our environment (jobs, schools, etc) so it makes our life more difficult. our parents didn't have to deal with the immigration of intelligent individuals that we have today. they didn't have the best and brightest from around the world flown in to compete for american jobs. we are obese and depressed because we haven't stepped away from the computer screen. kids don't play in their yards, they play xbox in the den. they don't go hang out in the way our parents did, instead, we chat away on instant messages. ","c0ay94o":"If I hate Microsoft so much, why am I using Windows 7 right this very moment?  Why do I use Microsoft Word whenever I write anything longer than a paragraph?  Why do I use Microsoft Excel for each spreadsheet I create that does more than a simple charting of data (Google Docs works well enough for that)?  Let's lay off of the caricature  for a moment, shall we?\n\nMaybe I just recognize a business model for what it is.  They take an idea from another company, and repackage it, with the goal of pushing the original crafter out of the business, and it's worked out pretty well for them.\n\nI'm not claiming the iPod was the first mp3 player, I'm claiming it was the best at the time.  Microsoft saw that, and wanted a piece of the market.  The same goes for everything they've ever made.  They don't have the ideas, they take the ideas and try to improve on them, but only after someone else has shown the idea to be profitable.  It's... safe, and safe is boring, and the methods they use to drive out the competition are often... unfriendly, and some would say illegal.\n\nNot to mention that their \"improvements\" oftentimes backfire, ending up with a product that has an incredibly high chance of overheating (xbox), a product that is inferior in almost every way to its competition (Zune), or a product that is such a blatant move against another company (Google).\n\nI do enjoy how you attack my claims at an almost personal level, using words like, \"comical\" and \"pathetic.\"  It adds to your shilling quite nicely.","c0ay9kg":"&gt;Let's lay off of the caricature for a moment, shall we?\n\nHard to do when you keep pushing a point that is comical at best.  But mostly just ignorant and strange.\n\nThe xbox is pretty damn successful and is currently the winner in microsoft vs sony.  The zune isn't exactly a wash, I know more people with zunes than ipods.  The original ipod had the market, but competition meant there was no way for them to keep it.  The same thing will happen with their iphone.\n\nAs for google, they pretty much have the search engine market.  It turns out people like a minimalist search engine. It would be stupid not to copy it.  Personally I think bing doesn't go far enough.  But at least Microsoft is making headway.  While yahoo just slowly dies.\n\nYou are basically criticizing Microsoft for competing.  I find that hilarious.  The market google had was once dominated by microsoft.  Why are you not criticizing google for ripping off hotmail?  Or word?  Or Excel?\n\nYou have a clear bias.  You deem it ok when someone takes from Microsoft but cheap and crappy when Microsoft takes from others.  And you don't seem to care when anyone non Microsoft takes from anyone else non Microsoft.","c0aycww":"mhh, that's strange. i'll just copy some more important things here (if you were thinking \"oh noe, another xbox arcarde shooter\" like me first):\n\n&gt;IGN: Right, so there was definitely no discussion to having a more arcade-like feel for the console? There was always a decision to keep it as a balance of action and simulation for both platforms?\n\n&gt;Jordan Weisman: Yeah, I think that MechWarrior was kind of the PC's first big action title, and even if you go back to MechWarrior 2, it certainly had sim aspects, but the sim component wasn't so overwhelming that it became inaccessible. We want to walk that line as well, that it's an action sim as you said, not a sim with action.\n\n__________\n\n&gt;IGN: That's cool, especially as a fan. What multiplayer modes will you be including within the game? Will you be including a Conquest-style mode like Multiplayer BattleTech 3025?\n\n&gt;Jordan Weisman: Our goal for multiplayer, and again, with the caveat of what the eventual budget is, but our goal is a Conquest-style mode. It's not an MMO by any means, but it is multiplayer with continuity and an arrow through time so we can release new updates into the multiplayer game as the timeline of the universe advances and that there are longer term goals for both players and for factions within the multiplayer setting. Again, it's not an MMO, but it is a kind of larger context to multiplayer.\n\n__________\n\n&gt;IGN: MechWarrior is well known for downloadable content and expansion packs, like clan mech packs. Is this something you've considered post launch, or would this be something for a sequel for either the PC or 360?\n\n&gt;Jordan Weisman: Certainly from our perspective, and this will have to be discussed with the publisher, but from our perspective, in the world in which we live, that content should be continuous and available via Xbox Live and downloadable on the PC. So we would prefer not to chunk it up into separate products but to keep it as an ongoing stream of content and there's different ways that we can accomplish that, but we also think there are fun ways to weave the fiction and the ongoing story into that continued distribution of new content.\n\n\n__________________\n\nthat (and the other quoted parts in the other thread and here) were the points where i smiled and thought \"yes, this is going to be great!\".\n\nhope it comes 2010 and is not vapoware, can'T handle another duke.","c0ayevu":"Guess they caved in the end. Probably the right choice though.

The moves just don't happen for me when I want them to.  I like the xbox controls of the buttons.  X is for a straight, Y is for a jab, A and B are for left and right hooks.  Using the left trigger in combination you can control the body blows vs. head shots and uppercuts.  The right trigger is for blocking (if ever necessary).  I would have picked this game up if it wasn't for the omission of the button controls.  EA realized their mistake by eliminating possible consumers and are trying to correct it.  Albeit a little late.  It's real surprising that EA of all publishers would limit their market like this.  I'm actually surprised they didn't make it a single button game.","c0ayymd":"I was thinking of making the same suggestion, but I think that you should rethink it.\n\nI just let my girl friend play portal earlier this week because she was very interested in it. She is a light gamer, shes played Chrono Trigger, some Final Fantasies and Ragnarok online. But when I put portal on her plate it was far too much. Keep in mind I'm talking about the xbox360 version however.\n\nTo the average gamer portal is very simple. To someone who has never used two thumbsticks, it was nearly impossible. She just could not do things as fast as you need to in that game because of her inexperience using the controller. Overall the puzzles seemed much harder for her than they were for me. I think being a gamer doing those kind of things all the time in FPS like HL2 it was easier for me to think about it than her.","c0ayzf7":"ds is like 110$? thats just a bit more than 1 new xbox\/ps3 game","c0az9c9":"Kids, do your parents protect your house with a gun?\nDo you want the new xbox? \nTurn in your parents and you get one thousand dollars...\n\nFuck Newark.","c0azbro":"GRID is a decent game.

Cheaper, no batteries, and no potential problems. Also, its a huge cable, I hope you are not playing that far away from your computer screen.\n\nActually a lot of games do work with the 360 controller. Almost any game that was developed for the pc and the 360 will have native access for the 360 controller on the pc. Even an old game like IL-2 Sturmovik(really fun flight sim) works fine with the 360 controller.","c0azi6s":"Me and my friends downloaded Tokyo Gore Police onto an xbox because we were bored.

When I was around 13 years old, I found a pretty clever 'hack' for xanga that would allow me to gain control over anybody's account. I reported it to xanga for months and nothing ever changed. What I did was set up a xanga account that would capture everybody's information that came to the page and grab their accounts and repost the script on their own page. It was pretty similar to the myspace smiley 'virus'.\n\nI let it build a few hundred accounts before I killed the script, but I netted even xanga admin accounts and eventually got a nice email from them. I don't want to go into details about the hack because even years later xanga never fixed the fundamental problem, but all they did was change it so the script just no longer self-propagated, but still otherwise worked. The proper fix was dead simple, just a matter of changing some subdomain around would have neutered a small but crucial piece of XSS, but despite being an amazingly popular service at the time, they were security amateurs. (They also stored passwords as plaintext, as an admin showed me my password to prove that he was in fact the admin.)\n\nAddendum: also, does anybody remember the viral site for the xbox 360 a few years back? The site was designed partially so teams could flood the simple forums and troll each other. However, they made some very serious amateur mistakes in their team image upload, where I could easily overwrite any files on the web server using a bit of escape hackery and directory transversal attacks. This is mainly just me bragging, but surely somebody has to remember wondering why the hell Richard Simmons images had invaded the homepage? The site was some sort of mystery competition, so forums were flooded with people trying to tie Richard Simmons in with the spider colony theme. The hack was quickly closed.\n\nI guess the moral of these stories is that even these super-popular websites aren't to be particularly trusted. Some of the guys running the security are nincompoops. (Not saying imageshack is, however. I have no idea how this was pulled off.)","c0azodw":"Got every single achievement for Portal on xbox.

Why are devs such as Epic dumping the PC and putting more and more emphasis on conssoles? \r\n\r\nBlizzard is trying to heavily integrate Star Craft with its internet service essentially making it a sort of MMO and as I've menitone dalready vlave probably won't keep pouring money into PC games as its flagship platform if piracy continues to thrive.\r\n\r\nIf you were a smart person instead of a fucking asshole you'd have read 'in the future for PC games' which is to say probably into the ps4\/xbox 720\/wii 2 set of consoles.","c0b95n6":"do it like real men do and use the .net C# Compiler from a makefile and write using gvim, or use sharpdevelop.\n\nIt's a different history if you are talking about XNA for the xbox, although it's still cheaper than $600.","c0b99dn":"[Here's a pretty good source](http:\/\/www.videogamer.com\/xbox360\/left_4_dead\/news\/valve_details_post_left_4_dead_launch_plans.html), but there are others if you search around.\n\nI think released content per time compared to what TF2 has gotten would be a reasonable benchmark.

But at least they got to keep their data and their money.\n\nGuess I'll go play my NES.  ","c0bikor":"They may have changed their policy as of late because I also have a friend at work that said M$ just repaired his for free even though it was out of warranty.  My personal experience with them was less than desirable.  \n\nI waited and bought my first 360 about a year and two months after the launch after hearing horror stories about the systems reliability(both on the internet and personal accounts from friends that bought launch consoles).  I assumed that after a year they would have quality control locked down but I didn't expect that there was an inherent design flaw that had nothing to do with QA.  My first 360 only lasted 3 weeks and then decided that it would no longer read 360 game discs.  I had no problem playing DVDs or original XBOX games, but everytime I tried to boot a 360 game disc it gave me the dirty disc error even though all 3 of my games that had previously worked had been bought new and had not a single smudge or surface scratch on them.  I had bought an extended warranty from the retail store(G$) but they said that their warranty wouldn't kick in until after the manufacturers warranty ran out(at the time 90 days).  I sent in my 360 for repair and 5 weeks later received an obviously refurbished unit with a different serial number and the system had scratches and smudges(looked like grease to me, the kind you lube your car axles with) all over the exterior.\n\nI was happy that the replacement worked but was quite upset that I'd spent $400 on a nice piece of technology that was intended(by me) to be the centerpiece of my living room entertainment center looked like it came from a second hand store.  I eventually got over the aesthetics of my replacement and just enjoyed the games I was playing until about 6 months later when I was visited by the RROD fairy.  This time I waited 4 weeks and received another replacement that looked like someone took a belt sander to it's outer case but again it worked so I was just happy to have a working unit back.  Another 9 months pass and once again the RROD gods are displeased with my hedonistic gaming lifestyle so I wait again for a new, new replacement.  This time on the phone with M$CS I expressed my discontent with the dirty garage sale units they have sent me in the past.  4 weeks later I receive a brand new console with a manufacturing date of only a month old and it's even still in its original plastic bag with its new car smell intact.  Needless to say I'm ecstatic.\n\nFast forward another 3 months and I again start to get the dirty disc error.  By now I've ammassed a 30+ game collection, have bought 40+ Live Arcade titles, multiple year long(12+1 month) Live sub cards, downloaded 20+ TV shows and rented countless movies.  Not to mention that I own arcade sticks, guitar controllers, 4 game pads with 6 rechargeable batteries and two chargers(play and charge and the wall one).  hell I've even spent &gt;$100 on DLC for the retail games I own.  I call up 18004myxbox like usual but they tell me I'm out of warranty.  I inform them that it has still been less than 3 years since my initial purchase.  They tell me that this is a DVD drive issue and that's only under warranty for 1 year from initial purchase.  I explain to them that the console has a manufactured date of only 4 months ago but they basically tell me pay $100 for the repair or tough shit.  I escalated my call 3 times, and sent countless emails but the best offer I got was \"we'll only charge you half for the repair.\"  \n\nIt sure is shitty customer service to try and gouge a loyal customer $100(or even $50) on a product with obvious design defects.  All in all I spent over $3000 on M$ console products and was told to sit and spin when they legally weren't liable anymore.  I already had a PS3 and I just traded in all of my games and accessories(to G$) and bought more games for it(PS3).  But I'll tell what I sure as hell miss XBOX LIVE.  I play most games on my PC anyway but I'm constantly reminded of the fun I could be having interacting with my LIVE buddies when I play Games for Windows Live enabled games on my PC like Fallout 3 and I see who's logged in and get messages from them that I should come play(because some of them are confused and think I bought a new 360 since many aren't PC gamers and aren't aware of LIVE even being on the PC).\n\nI know this was a long ass story but my only point was that even though the 360 is plagued by defects and seems like it can burst into flames at any moment regardless of the hardware revisions made, I'll still probably buy another one just because LIVE is so damned intuitive and convenient for online gaming and communication.

That's just a pathetic fail rate.","c0bix0d":"&gt; I wasn't arguing just the mouse; as a whole both control scheme's have their limitations. Keyboards have more limitations than the movement with an analog stick.\n\nYou know, nothing keeps you from using a mouse and a joystick. if you really wanted you could hook up an xbox 360 controller to a PC, use the left hand on the controller and the right hand on the mouse. I've never seen anyone want to do this, but nothing is stopping you.\n\n&gt; Ok, the first problem is you're attempting to compare apples to oranges on how sweet they are. Analog is acceleration based, ... Mouse is position based\n\nFirst of all, your analogy is flawed. If you hadn't added in the clause about \"how sweet they are\" you would have been fine, but with that in there what you are saying is you cannot take two dissimilar things and compare them on a single common trait, which is completely false. I can compare grapes to watermelons if I am strictly talking about size and nothing else, the watermelon clearly wins (assuming larger is better). Similarly, if I am talking about two dissimilar control schemes (acceleration based vs position based) I can absolutely compare them side by side on certain criteria, which is what I am doing.\n\nSo, why do I claim that mice have more sensitivity? Because of the range allowed. Let's be honest, at some level both the mouse and the analog stick are digital indicators. You can rant and rave how \"analog\" sticks are analog, 'look it says right there in the name!' but it is being interpreted by a computer which means it has to be digitized at some point. Because of this, the analog stick has a certain fixed number of speeds that it can operate at (and I would be willing to bet money that the software programming limits it even further, just because programmers are lazy. Allow for 20 different speeds and 95% of the population won't notice). So you can set a sensitivity, which is actually just a multiplier for the speed, meaning you also increase the difference in speed from step to step when you increase the sensitivity.\n\nA mouse is also a digital instrument, because it works in dots per inch. A mouse has a given DPI, and a sensitivity to go along with it to determine the multiplier of how far it moves per dot it detects. The thing is mice have such a high DPI, up to 4000 for high end gaming mice. Just so you know, a DPI of 4000 means there is one dot per 0.00025 inches, or just over 6,000 NANOmeters. As a comparison, the wavelength of red light is about 650 nanometers. I can guarantee you that any analog stick does not have anywhere near that resolution.\n\nOn top of that, even if the mouse and joystick had comparable resolution, the way the mouse calculates actual speed is multiplying the DPI by how fast you move it. With the joystick, there is a maximum to how far you can tilt it. To a mouse there is effectively no limit, so the mouse would have a much larger number of digital steps that is included in the range, giving the mouse more sensitivity.\n\n&gt; Mouse is position based, you move left, and you look left a corresponding distance. Once you stop moving the mouse, you stop looking. There is no maximum travel of a joystick... in the instance where you have lower sensitivity settings, the joypad certainly wins, as you don't have to repeatedly pick up your mouse to move it.\n\nAlright, so I thought I could glaze over this topic here because this particular point is kind of dumb IMO, but since you bring it up lets talk about this. You are arguing that the joystick has an advantage over the mouse because the mouse you have to pick up and move if you want to cover a very large distance. My counter argument to this is anyone with controls customized sanely will not hit this limit all the time, and will be able to have a large amount of control of when this happens. My mouse sensitivity is set so that from the center of the mousepad left to right I can do a complete 360 before hitting the edge of my pad, and most of my friends have a higher sensitivity. So when will you ever be in combat and need more than 720 degrees of motion? Only when you are dancing around each other in circles, which if you do nothing but circles is kind of dumb and extremely predictable. Other than that, when you get near the limit or after you turn and are safe, you move your mouse back to the center giving you the full motion when you need it. Because of this, the factor of having to pick up and move the mouse during the time that it actually counts (when in combat and trying to aim quickly and accurately) rarely comes into play, if ever. Also, if you were ever inclined to do so, you could bind a key to turn as well so you would have the ability to turn while your mouse is in the air.\n\n&gt; I consider a handicap one which prevents you from being on equal ground. You say a handicap just has to make it harder. Ok, it is harder to learn the joystick, but that doesn't mean an experienced player will play any worse with it.\n\nOk, if that is what you consider a handicap then we SHOULD be in agreement. I suppose I should have stated this more clearly, but if my earlier arguments were to be accepted (that it takes longer to aim with a joystick and it is less accurate) that would fall under your definition of a handicap. If the time it takes me to aim from A to B is 1 foo, and yours is 2 foo, having nothing to do with skill, then you are prevented from being on even ground.\n\n&gt; It's not enough that when Shadowrun came out they had to handicap the Gamepad players because they were consistently doing better than the PC players\n\nUmm... citation needed? I looked around online and could find absolutely NO evidence of that claim. However, on the [wikipedia article](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shadowrun_%282007_video_game%29) for Shadowrun, I did find this nifty tidbit:\n\n\"Because of the lack of 'pixel-accuracy' with the Xbox 360 analog thumbstick, the designers have included an aim-assisting technology, which basically interpolates the player's movement and causes the reticle to stay over an enemy player like a weak magnet. In addition, FASA has implemented a feature which causes the crosshair to expand during quick movements, thus lowering the player's accuracy, making it impossible to quickly turn and maintain accuracy, reducing the potential advantage of playing with a mouse.[6][7] PC players, who have a more sensitive control scheme, are able to turn significantly faster than their controller-using counterparts and would have gained an unfair advantage.\"\n\nNow I am no rocket scientist, but that seems to completely contradict everything you claimed. Instead of giving the console users a handicap, they intentionally went out of their way to handicap the PC users. They added in auto-aim for the console, and they made fast adjustments that can only be done on the mouse decrease accuracy significantly. So they improved the aim on console AND hindered the aim on PC. Seems pretty extreme to me if the gamepad players were doing better than the PC players so consistently.\n\n&gt; This HAS been done, several times... Do you honestly think that each time it happens it's just a fluke?\n\nOk, the only example you gave was Shadowrun, and you were provably wrong on your claims. You want to take another stab at giving an example that supports your position instead of one that supports mine? Oh, and if you do provide any I'd appreciate some citations to somewhere that backs up your claim.\n\n&gt; There are many cases where gamepad players have gone against KM players, and there hasn't been clear superiority.\n\nIf you actually read the end of my post, you would have read this little disclaimer that addresses this:\n\n&gt; Am I saying that you cannot be good with a joystick? No. Am I saying that someone can't be more comfortable on the joystick if that is what they are most experienced with? No. What I am saying is... I'd be willing to bet that if the BEST FPS gamers on PC played against the BEST FPS gamers on console on a given game, each with their control scheme of choice, the PC gamers would win. (CAPS added for emphasis)\n\nAgain, I am not saying that every person using KM is better than every person using an analog stick. There is no reason why someone using an analog stick couldn't beat someone using a mouse, so anecdotal evidence of \"I did that experiment with a friend and I kicked his ass!\" holds absolutely no water whatsoever in this argument.","c0bix87":"Well I can't say how much success I'll have with that as I've never had to tinker with my xbox, besides opening it up to initially check out the tray.\n\nThat thread goes a little over my head, but its probably easier than it sounds.

Once it is apart, there should only be two pieces that move in relation to each other. \n\nGet to that point, and gluing a little square of plastic where the button meets the plastic is trivial. \n\nEdit: Personally, this gave my Launch Xbox another year(ish) before I finally had to replace t he dvd drive. I would recommend pulling the key off of your dvd drive ASAP, since it has to play a disk to pull the key off. If it doesn't work at first, keep trying, and give it a good smack. \n\nIt is not too great for the dvd drive, but the key is much more important than your DVD drive, as it is required for ANY dvd drive to work in that xbox (for games, it will play movies just find)","c0bkmk3":"That my friends is cool as anything. I'm impressed. Very.  At least my PS3 doesn't give me those stupid red-rings.  God that has really been winding me up. Onto my 3rd xbox and first ps3. That alone makes me love sony. They haven't given me as much pain as microsoft.","c0bkrj2":"Seriously...dude..type less about wanting things that don't exist and just get better at the games you think are cool.

And was only 15 bucks","c0bksb7":"I enjoy cheating in games that I don't really want to get into in the first place.  Sometimes I just like to mess around within the construct of the game, or just pwn.  Any game on my xbox NES emulator, that I play, will have all my self-found cheats in it.  It's quite fun to swim through the air in Mario 1, or never lose lives in Battletoads.","c0bkuui":"The PS2 thing is a pretty common misconception.

These days I generally only play games when other people who are better than I am are around for me to watch. I still own like 20 xbox games.\n\nWhat I found is that I can excel at games like Civ and Sim City. Some RTS games are a bit too intense in multiplayer (like StarCraft where build order is super important), but when I'm in a situation where I can control the pace and my success isn't based on my reflexes, I do alright, but once I try to bring that confidence to Halo or whatever, I start freezing up and lose interest pretty quickly. So check out slower paced RTS\/turn based style games where your reflexes don't matter as much and you might have more luck.\n\nAlso, depending on your age and history, there are dozens of Zelda games for older platforms like Gameboy that you can pick up for real cheap and play on a DS or even emulation if you want to do that, and they are all really fun and rely very little on reflexes. These can help build your confidence for other games, they are generally a blast to play, and help is easily come by.\nIf you're into PC games, maybe check out stuff like Sins of a Solar Empire or Galactic Civilizations 2 in addition to the more common RTS\/turn based games.","c0bl3oh":"Yeah, most of them are, just like on xbox. But the 'no games' bullshit started when PS3's library was admittedly small compared to xbox's. Since then, it has gotten plenty new exclusives and multiplatforms to shed that 'no games' stuff off.\n\nI guess we differ on what's considered overly expensive. For everything you get with that 400$, PS3 is excellent value. Easily and cheaply upgradable HDD, wlan and 'play and charge kit' built in and blu-ray, all of which would cost more than that 100$ difference to get on xbox. And I doubt you can get a 400$ PC that could run all the games that PS3 can. I haven't looked at the prices though.","c0bl8fi":"I meant in general I want kiddie gamers off of my xbox live matches.","c0blpik":"**Ok, how is Apple\/ATT rejecting apps any different from Nintendo, MS, or Sony rejecting games for the ps3, xbox, Wii** Games that get above the M rating on ESRB get rejected all the time.

What makes this situation so different.","c0bm5w3":"Ive been wondering should i get fallout for my xbox or my pc, I like the idea of the pc mods possible but i dont have a very good video card. I have a decent processor and 6gb of memory so im kinda torn. suggestions?\n","c0bmdj9":"Nothing is great about the wii. The games are stale and gimmicky. Nothing is great about the 360, or PS3 either.\n\nMY 2c.\n\nBoth have pretty poor game libraries compared to the same time in the SNES, PS2, PS1, N64 lives. Xbox 360 has the advantage of having nothing to live up to, because the first xbox was pretty bad too. Most of the good games are cross-platform, making the \"software\" advantages between the two almost moot.\n\nI cannot stand the dual shock controller; it's unergonomic, the analog sticks need to be moved to more comfortable positions and lowered, and it irks me. I really don't like the user interface of the PS3 either, and the bluray player on the household one has been spotty at best (recently, anyways: got our first DRE last week). I muchly prefer the 360 controller, but the system has a bad track record (though I've never had any system ever die, except my DS) and not a great library, it's just big. \n\nI can't really speak on the online for either: I've been told the 360 online is a much more stable, fun experience, but microsoft fanboys can also be thickheaded and boisterous, so... I play all my online games on the PC, so it's kinda moot for me. We've nowhere near filled either machine, seeing as all we do is save game files on them (why save media on them when you can stream media from your computer to them over your network?). \n\nI don't hate the PS3 more than I hate this generation of consoles in general. Each generation, there's been an amazing console full of innovative games moving forward and trying new and interesting things (NES, SNES, N64 and PS1, PS2). That's disappeared. \n\nWhich is why I game on my PC. Most the good games come out on PC as well, albeit later and cheaper, and modding communities give me an infinite resource of ROMs, Fallout Mods, Bethesda-game mods, FPS mods... basically, the modding communities make PC gaming endlessly fun, even when developers are basically releasing poo.","c0bmm82":"I recommend soliciting foundations as advertisers. reddit has shown its generosity on various occasions. It would be simple to convince some  them by example. Im thinking make a wish foundation.

It made the whole game much more fun - give it a try. It's not ALL bad. ","c0bmqhp":"As much as I am neutral towards each platform. I think that each console has its disadvantages. For example:\n\n* The Wii is affordable, has some great first party titles and has free online play (through Nintendo WFC), however, it seems to have done quite a few things in a bad way. The graphics are good but not in HD, the games released on the Wii aren't that good, plus the online play is too restrictive (24 digit friend codes are not a good idea)\n* The xbox 360 has a large library of games, and many exclusive and multiplatform titles already. However, the failure rate of them is apparently quite high, plus the online play through Xbox Live is subscription based.\n* The PS3 is quite expensive, although the hardware is good, the game library is getting better and better, and online play through Playstation Network is also free.","c0bmumo":"Eh, I don't know, I think it really all depends on the attach rate of the console.  If they can lower the price of the console and be guaranteed to sell tons more games, then it very well might be in their best interest to do so.  I know that I, and many of my friends, haven't purchased a PS3 simply because the price is so high.  I *do* like it marginally better than the xbox (although I prefer the 360's controller), but I just don't feel like spending more than 300 on a console.","c0bmzo2":"Surprisingly enough, the footage is of his outraged reaction to finding out that his xbox live account was banned.

If it stored music on the iPod the same way flash drives (and 3rd party mp3 players) do, you'd be able to copy your mp3s directly through Windows Explorer.  This would severely limit their chances to get you to buy music from their store.\n\nBetter yet, just get a splitter for your ipod: it will go from your headphone jack to two RCA jacks.  Instead of trying to manage your ipod from the xbox, just plug the ipod straight into the stereo.  Grab one for about $3 from Walmart.","c0bn5wt":"Hopefully the OP doesn't mind if I answer some questions too. I had a vasectomy last year and I'm very happy I did it.\r\n\r\n* I did, but only because that was \"what you did when you growed up\".\r\n* There's a few reasons. Mostly it's because we both have five siblings, and we're both number two in the birth order, so we both grew up with babies \/ small children in the house, so the luster of raising a kid is pretty much lost for us. On top of this, we're both fairly introverted, so we like the peace and quiet. We also love to travel, and we enjoy moving around, trying out new areas, etc. \r\n* Yes, two cats. I don't have any illusions about pets as kids. They aren't. They're cats. They would eat our dead bodies given the opportunity.\r\n* It was about $250 I believe. Yes, insurance, but I've seen some places that charge something like $350 tops without insurance. It's not an expensive proceedure.\r\n* I had mine done on Friday morning, frozen peas on my crotch all day friday and saturday while I played xbox and watched movies, and my wife and I had sex on Sunday morning.\r\n* None whatsoever. I popped maybe three iburprofen on the day of, and no discomfort aftarwards whatsoever. I was pretty diligent about the ice part. The incisions were barely noticable. No stitches needed, they healed on their own.","c0bn6cc":"but what if he is right?\n\nI mean, really, I saw David Axelrod saying '..people across the country will be discussing their struggles with healthcare at the kitchen table...'

He's always challenging people to xbox games or broadcasting live from his room with his friends.

Just kinda people you say hi to if you see them at the store but not someone I would have over to the house unless there was a large gathering of some sort to invite them to.\n\nBatch of somewhat closer friends that I see at least once a month.  These friends generally know Im a pot head, know where I work, but have no clue about my psychedelic habits.  These are the friends that I would invite over to watch a movie or go to a show etc.  Good friends but not close friends.\n\nOnly about 4 very close friends, that fall into the best friends category.  These are the people I see at least once a week, that stop by unannounced and are always welcome etc.  The friends who know everything about each other and talk\/chat\/text\/or email with daily about something.\n\nOf my four best friends only one is as successful thus far.  He is a lawyer, recently graduated and working for a large firm.  Two of them are just average guys.  One works as a newspaper editor in a very small town, he loves the job enough to overlook the nearly minimum wage pay.  The other is working as a bank teller, did survey work before that.  Definitely not ambitious or career driven like I have been.  Then there is the burnout.  One of my buddies is a complete burnout with no job or ambition to speak of. He dates fat chicks with money who pick up the tab, and couch surfs when he cant find women willing to take him in.  Generally his life revolves around smoking pot and playing xbox.

I can completely understand not doing updates for either game, since this strategy doesn't make as much financial sense for single player games, and the CS community tends to react negatively to change.\n\nPerhaps another question: when Valve originally announced they were going to do TF2-style updates for L4D, should we have believed them?  A cynical answer would have been no, perhaps backed by the unfortunately always technology safe view of \"unless it is on the shelves, it doesn't exist\".\n\nI'd hate to see a future where we'd collectively respond to announcements from Valve such as \"in the future, we'll do cool things X, Y, and Z to game A\" with \"yeah, whatever.  Come back when you've actually got something to show.\"  That hardly seems optimal for anyone, neither for the community nor for Valve.  For better or worse, that does seem to the future we're heading towards.","c0bpifx":"Valve is trying to release DLC for TF2 on the 360, but the game apparently already pushes the systems limits as it is. This makes it extrordinarily difficult for them to release the DLC as it is. This is also coupled with their desire to possibly release it in one big chunk instead of smaller downloads, mainly due to Micro$oft forcing them to price the DLC. The big chunk would be cheaper than little pieces, so thats whats up for the 360 as far as I know. As for the PS3 version, Valve didn't even release that, [that was outsourced by Valve to EA](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Orange_Box). I have heard rumors that Valve isn't even going to support it, as shown by the recent 360 patch and the lack of one for the PS3 version.

Not to mention that I get free online play and a bluray player.\n\nSo let's add this up, to get your 360 to have similar features as a PS3 it'll cost you 150 (wifi) + 150 (hd) + 60 (controller) + 30 (live subscription) on top of the original purchase, so that's 200 + 390 = 590 fucking dollars, with a recurring payment of 30 to play online.

The maps aren't anywhere near as fun as Halo 2, the matchmaking still has the same problems, the new defensive measures like personal shields really ruin the game, the gameplay hasn't evolved at all, nobody has a microphone on, the weapons are the same but with new skins. \n\nBasically a lazy piece of shit money grab from MS.

It may make you feel bad because you have to work harder, but I don't think that gives you any kind of real ability to analyze how much and whether he loves you or not.  Maybe he thinks it's good for you to work.  Maybe you don't understand him as well as you think.  Maybe he's a selfish dick.  Who knows?

I've always wondered why people didn't get into the Halo story as much as I did.  To me, it's just a really kickass epic story in every way.  The music is spot on, the concept of being the last best hope of humanity is pretty cool and made cooler by the fact that you're a 7 foot tall cyborg supersoldier who started off relatively anonymous in Halo 1 and by the end of Halo 3, you're revered by friend and foe alike.  The books weren't bad either.  Some decent writing  in them as far as video game books go.  \n\nI just really love the whole completed story.  As for the gameplay, it's pretty fun but secondary to me.  Loved the visuals and few, if any games, have made me that pumped up when playing them through the first time.

Whodathunk!\n\nSeriously though, the real answer is that the console manufacturer sets the price tiers, and the publishers will pick which tier they will release their game into.\n\nIt just so happens that PS3 and XBOX360 have one tier: 60 bucks.\n\nNintendo has several, based on platform.\n\nRetail PC games have a limited number of tiers, but there is no manufacturer setting those; it's industry collusion.\n\nNow, as far as markdowns for \"older\" games: these are technically set by the retailer, but the retailer gets cues from the manufacturer. E.g. you will RARELY see a first-party nintendo title marked down (even for sales), and even then, it will take years for a simple ten dollar drop.\n\nNot all retailers follow the cues, one notable (and awesome) exception being Kmart, who will mark down random games every three months to deep discounts, and not just the crap that doesn't sell. I've gotten tons of great deals on great games from these markdowns.\n\nNow, as far as the analogy to cars goes, it really doesn't make sense to think of these products as cars. It makes more sense to think of them as movies (theater release) or dvds or music cds. They are mass market entertainment purchases.\n\nThe car market, on the other hand, is segmented by financial demographics. In your demographic, all cars really do cost the same amount of money (with wiggle room to give you a false sense of \"getting a deal\"). Most car buyers have already decided how much they are going to spend on a car. It is never a choice between the 25k practical toyota camry and the 60k mercedez sportster.\n\nThere are signs, however, that the gaming market is becoming segmented like the car market.\n\nYou can buy games online now for much lower prices. the explosion of \"casual gaming\" has added another tier to the mix. You even start to see these games showing up more and more at retail, in a very low-priced tier. And as others have stated, this lower tier has actually started to influence the console manufacturers as well. Not only has it affected nintendo's retail price tiers, but now that we've got things like Wiiware and xboxlive, we are seeing this lower tier start to dominate downloadable games for consoles.","c0bzbve":"...

It's in the custom games menu. I don't really have much to say about the ranking system. It's pretty shit, but I haven't cared about rank for quite a while. I play all social games.

To us, work has the added value has being emotionally fulfilling-- we're motivated by more than what keeps us alive, because most of the time we don't think about survival. Our extra income allows us more options than \"starve\/no starve\", but rather comforts or entertainment. So going from \"small studio junk food lifestyle\" to \"two-bedroom house organics lifestyle\" is about emotional well being, rather than physical.\n\n\"Keeping us alive\" is different from their context than ours, since we expect more than a bag of flour and a bottle of oil in a straw hut.\n\nWe're then looking at a context of people who's been struggling to feed their children, and suddenly receiving an influx of income allowing them to survive. Their values of success is thus based on \"can you afford a doctor when you get sick\" rather than \"can you afford a new HDTV for your xbox 360\", and when the former is consistently fulfilled, they'll need to replace those values with \"find work that is emotionally fulfilling\"-- which comes from education.\n\nIf right now the government paid every citizen a $700\/month income (about what one gets from welfare in a more affluent state), or a $400\/month bonus regardless of their salary, you'll see a spike in citizen happiness in the short run, simply because they now can afford MORE bonuses than what they're used to.

I had an xbox 360 for about three years and never registered for xbox live, as I found the most enjoyable way to play was to have friends in the room.

Kegging your beer rather than bottling it is a much easier process, and can cut months off the process.

They dont deny it, they say its not accurate.  What is accurate is they need to keep the old setup due to old xbox games (which basically means halo and halo 2 have such large player bases on the old xbox that if they expanded past 100 friends it would break the old console).  \n\nWhat a bunch of liars, just sidestep the issue with vague dialog.","c0c4xar":"i checked the specs and they arent too bad for a freebie.  I would turn it into a medic pc for sure.  If you have an xbox 360 you can just stream content from the pc onto the tv and put the tower in a closet or something.  use remote connections from inside the network to do all the dirty work.

I don't... have much bad to say about the PS3 since they tried to build it with quality parts, but the downfall was that it cost so much upon original release.\n\nPC truly is the best platform because it is a console, but it is also everything else those consoles try to be.  The only thing holding it down at all is running a resource heavy OS at the same time it is running a game.  Exclusives are the only reason to buy a console, PCs can do all that and more considering you can manually upgrade them whereas consoles don't give you that advantage.\n\nPeople like consoles because they don't know any better or because there are exclusives on them.","c0c5dp1":"Here's my two cents:\n\n- Bitrate and format depends on which devices you want to use. If you've got a console make sure you use a compatible format so you can use them as well. The newer the codec, the smaller the files. But then you might not be able to play on that many machines. If your machine's are up for it, i'd go with MPEG4 of some sorts. Not sure about the bitrate though.\n\n\n- I doubt you can run 3 machines on a wireless network while streaming 3 video's. But i depends on the network, and on how small you've made the files.\n\n\n- I use vlc as well.\n\n\n- About the videocard: I'd say get an xbox360 or a ps3.

I have heard about them scratching disc's but have never had it happen to me.  I think microsoft handles warrant problems well.  I even scratched my halo 3 disc while my xbox was gone (left it out of a case and kept dropping it\/putting stuff on it) and they will allow you to send in the damage disc and buy another for 25 dollars iirc, which was a big difference from the 60 dollar price tag in stores.\n\nEDIT, I bought the 360 within a month of release, the RROD took about a year to show up. of course it showed up the 1st time Christmas morning when i took it home from college so my sister could play her guitar hero present she got for Christmas","c0c5uow":"If I remember correctly the xbox renders it at 720p which is only 1280x720.

Too slow for even non-fullscreen youtube vids.  So now I have a linux partition on my PS3 that I don't use.  Ever.\n\nBut even with that said, there are plenty of uses for a Linux partition.

I'm [sure](http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/xbox360\/rpg\/ageofconanhyborianadventures\/index.html) that will [come](http:\/\/www.huxleygame.com\/) out.","c0c6gvo":"Myself and my friends are all 25-27ish.  We got nice jobs and do the gym routine either before or after work.  We're in great shape.  We like getting high or drunk and playing wii or xbox live all the time.  Not many of my friends like the ps3 though.  We know its a more powerful console, but we don't like the controller...Anyway I don't think that study is accurate.  Most of the gamers I know are of normal shape to in somewhat good shape.  Most of the gamers I know play mostly fps on live, Wii, and the occasional rpg.  Maybe my friends and I aren't the gamers the article is talking about, but I smoke up and play live almost daily.  Side note (Maybe thats a pot issue...haha)  I agree that we all have heard the stories of the stereotypical fat gamer nerd who just plays games their entire life.  That was in the past.  Now, pretty much everyone I meet is a gamer.  We have parties all the time, drinking , smoking, playing wii, or having the guys over, drinking playing cod or halo, and talking trash.  Its fun.  My past two gf's play video games, and they are regular good looking girls who drink beer, watch the sox, and play video games.  Lots of people are gamers now, its just a matter of how much time you play and what constitutes a game.  This article tries to tie hardcore gamers to an unhealthy lifestyle.  The wii has changed that, and actually helps you burn calories.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the article attempts to link video gaming with anti-social behavior.  I believe the opposite.  Rockband is one of the most sociable things to do nowadays.  It brings people together.  Xbox live halo and cod sessions with your buds, while sipping and smoking bud?  Come on, that brings people together.  When you go on a killing frenzy on halo 3, in front of your friends, thats just mojo...\r\n\r\nAnyway, the point is this article fails to define what they claim is a gamer, and what gamer behaviors are healthy\/unhealthy.  MSNBC is a nice liberal tv station, but sometimes subjects not covered much on this network seem to get only generic or sterotypic coverage\/judgement.  I personally only know a few fat gamers, but thats just my area in maine.  I'd say MSNBC has not done their research on what they consider a \"gamer.\"  The article seems to blanket the entire game subject as unhealthy, but does playing Wii Yoga and Wii Fit constitute as \"games,\" even though they help burn calories?  MSNBC also fails to research the millions of people who socialize and play Live, Rockband or Wii.

I went online and filled out my information, which took about 5 minutes, and I had a tracking number within 15 minutes.  They are sending a package over night so I can ship my console over night to get repaired.  All of this for free.  \n\nI personally don't mind the temporary lack of gaming if it means that I can always have my xbox 360 repaired and shipped for free.  They are not avoiding their mistake and spending a lot of money to help the situation.  ","c0cfoab":"Replete with xbox consoles from the considerate stores!","c0cfp5d":"It's pretty clear that you don't like apple, and no one is forcing you to - but you're using that as license to rant on with patently incorrect information. I like writing about this stuff because I'm fascinated just how wrong people get the facts, and simply refuse to actually acknowledge what actually goes on out there.\n\n\nI'll be brief, to address the points you made in this point-counterpoint manner\n\n&gt;At least they had a choice to not use Windows. They didn't even have the option to run Apple's OS and when a compnay did offer a fully legit, licensed version of Apple's OS on their own hardware they were quickly sued out of business.\n\nI assume you're talking about the Pystar case(or rambling, not entirely sure there), the computers they make require a hacked-up version of OS X, this is not a legitimate operation and reselling this kind of derivative works is copyright infringement in the USA. If you're talking about the clones of the early 90s, the licensing agreements finished and were not renewed, nothing special occurred back then.\n\n&gt;Are you ignoring how the iPhone works when you posted this? On Windows any 3rd party developer can create a program and sell it to you without any approval process from MS. Try that with the iPhone. Having the OS maker decide what the consumer can install and the developer can create for its platform is far more anti-competitive then mangling a few API's.\n\nPoint 2. It would only be anticompetitive if you couldn't buy any other phone. MS, Palm, Nokia all have app stores too and all had the ability to run apps before the iPhone even happened. Apple have provided and documented the APIs for their platform, they have also set out the rules in which to engage the platform, and have been remarkably clear in what they'll distribute through their application network. This is not the same as Windows, with MS deliberately denying competitors access to APIs &amp; file format documentation, and definitely not the same as changing APIs to deliberately break competitors software. The iphone &amp; Mac OS platform actually give overwhelming access to create and interact with all the media files. In fact iTunes creates a file called iTunes library.xml, iTunes itself doesn't use this file. This file is specifically so other applications can easily read and use the itunes library. Palm is an excellent example of a company who are deliberately trying to make a fuss - they have all the tools they need to make a piece of syncing software that will use the itunes library, but instead they'd rather impersonate ipod devices(a breach of the USB t&amp;cs) to try and get syncing inside iTunes.\n&gt;I am curious how IIS would know IE is being used and where you got this tidbit from? I am genuinely curious. I would also argue Netscape played a pivotal roll in its own demise. The software got very crappy very fast all IE did was provide a better more user friendly alternative to a bloated dieing piece of crap.\n\nPoint 3. IIS &amp; IE worked together using non-standard transfer methods, for this reason IIS was able to transmit pages quicker to IE, at the same time a standards compliant browser was left waiting. Do a google it was well published.(why on earth you wouldn't before actually writing a reply is lame). Also IE was based on the Mosaic browser, and if you do a little bit of history reading, you'll see that Mosaic -was- Netscape, so it's hard to describe it as superior in any sense - the programs were virtually identical, they worked in a very similar way and shared code. I.E. your argument here (as above) is utter unresearched bullshit.\n\n&gt;The vendors could have ignored DirectX, MS didn't force them to use DirectX nor did it block OpenGL from running on its platform.\n\nPoint 4. DirectX is a perfect example of a monopoly at work - if Microsoft don't support a method out of the box, then hardware makers won't make hardware to support it, as there is a limited audience. That is how businesses work - you don't make products if there is no market. The only reason OpenGL has vendor support is due to it's cross platform nature. The exact situation happened with USB on windows - many motherboard manufacturers did not include USB because windows would not support it, likewise HUD makers didn't use USB because no computers had it. The exact same thing happened with S3, EFI, ieee 1394, the list goes on. This is how a monopoly stifles innovation.\n\n&gt;The tameness of the action doesn't make it right. It is still anti-competitive and it is still wrong.\n\nPoint 5. If you make an app, which goes against the terms and conditions and it gets rejected, is it really the vendors fault? Meanwhile the reasons were actually pretty clearly laid out in the FCC response (take that reply from apple however you will - but it's probably the most official word you'll get on the matter.)\nYou probably need to stop thinking about the iPhone as your home computer and start thinking about it in the same way that you would treat your nintendo, xbox or ps2, which all use the same software model. (Heck even zune uses this model now - so much for your pro-microsoft argument.)","c0cfqbs":"I also can't install apps on my fridge, what's your point?

The key is to replace the X-Clamps with some new screws and washers. The screws and washers put pressure straight down on the chips instead of the odd angled pressure provided by the X-Clamps.\n\n[Here is the method I use when doing an X-clamp repacement.](http:\/\/copronymous.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/05\/fix-for-the-3rlod.pdf) PDF warning!\n\n**Skip step 7 the first time you do it!

There is a chance it won't on the first try, but you would be surprised how often it works right off. The best part is that the parts are only around $5 at Lowes. It's very important you get the same parts listed in the tutorial. There isn't much room in the 360 case, so the size and dimensions are critical.\n\n[Here are the parts if you are closer to a Home Depot than a Lowes.](http:\/\/forums.xbox-scene.com\/index.php?showtopic=674440) You will also see a few more different x-clamp methods, but stick with Lawdawg0931's. It's the easiest, most straight forward, and delivers great success. \n\nThe only thing I would suggest that isn't in the tutorial is to drill some holes in the metal motherboard tray. You want to drill out the 8 holes formerly used by the x-clamps. This allows the heads of the machine screws to drop below the tray when you replace the motherboard. I use a 13\/32\" drill bit. If this doesn't make sense, let me know and I can take some pics.\n\nGive it a shot, and let me know if it works or not. It should get you functional again. If it doesn't, you could always try to heatgun it. I have been heatgunning all my 360s because it not only helps the x-clamp fix work, but also makes the fixed 360 last longer.\n\n[Here is a good heatgun guide.](http:\/\/xbox-experts.com\/e\/tutorial.php?n=heatgunisol)  **Just be careful not to burn any capacitors.** \n\n**Oh, and buy some extra nylon washers.

So, they get the word out there that their product, at times, fails (usually consumers are great at spreading this. stats say when someone has a good experience with a product\/company, they tell 5 other people. if they have a bad experience, they tell 10), this means that if you go to buy a new TV and your friend had his crap out, when the guy says \"only $30 a month for 5 years of warranty\" you jump on it. \"You corporate bastards wont hoodwink me into having to buy a new TV! thats a waste of my money!\" but the truth is, you're buying a new tv anyway with the warranty price. \r\n\r\nThe companies that care about their products give it a lifetime warranty.

MS just needs to fix the damn browser.\n\nHe also says that it's useless unless a manufacturer cleans up the UI themselves.  Well, that's exactly what they do.  Touchflo 3d is phenomenal looking and rivals other mobile OSes, provided the hardware has the juice to run it.  Has he ever used vanilla android?\n\nOkay, other stupid things about this article:  \n\"Symbian has Nokia firmly behind it\", rumor is nokia is ditching symbian in favor of maemo. \n\n\"Yeah, there are a bunch of WinMo phones out there, but people don't have whole businesses, major apps, and peripherals tied to them\"  this is in the context of microsoft ditching the WM system in favor of something new.  The last two companies I interned at used windows mobile phones exclusively for their fleet phones in favor of blackberry or whatever.  I'm not sure if that means there were security type apps running on the wm phones that they needed, so this point might be a bit subjective.  \n\n Finally, dude says that iphone OS is constantly getting better.  Like I said already, I use an iphone but the core operating system hasn't seen a significant change (unless you jailbreak!) since 1.0 released in 2007.  They basically have added in rudimentary features that other mobile operating systems have had for years.  My aforementioned wm5 phone from years ago had copy and paste, 3rd party apps and wi-fi.  It might have had the worst web browser EVER, but i didn't have to load a hacked rom to play an NES emulator either. \n\nI think wm7 definitely has potential.  Look at the signs that microsoft is finally going to stop fucking around and actually integrate everything.  Zune HD has nearly the same interface as 6.5.  I'd be very surprised if they didn't add zune drmed music playback to wm7.  This one simple little feature would give zune a gigantic huge install base and a plausible threat to the itunes ecosystem.  xbox is finally getting SOME level of zune support and windows 7 actually has people excited for a microsoft product again.  I feel bad for MS, even though I'm a mac guy I really hope they finally knock it out of the park and start putting out bad ass products again.  \n\nThat's all I got.  Sorry for the length of this post, please don't downvote it into submission as i feel it does have some merit behind it.  Why is this even in the apple subreddit?

I would imagine that most people who look down on you think that you're a very isolated person.\n\n* It's not conducive to healthful living. Obviously playing sports has a physical benefit that stationary activities don't. I would imagine your sister also looks down on the person who plays Xbox all weekend. People who are really into being healthy will often assume that you don't play sports, work out, etc. because you're lazy, which is an attribute that I think most people look down on.\n\n* Stereotypes.

Never expect a girl to hit on you, and if she does, prepare to be the bitch because she owns you if you bite.\n\nWith regards to money: Your parents are probably doing it wrong. Ignore them. Here's the deal; when you buy something knowing you have more money coming to you: don't. Only make significant purchases when you already have at least that much money still kicking around. If you ever make a purchase that puts your bank account to 0 (ever) your going to spend the next &lt;however long till payday&gt; hating yourself for it, and you won't even enjoy your new Xbox Controller... or whatever it is you kids buy today... *looks at my new xbox controller that i regret buying*.\n\nWith regards to personal rules: Don't make exceptions.

I had my first drink when I was almost 19 and all I regret is not picking it up when I was 15-16. It was an amazing new feeling and I have enjoyed it since.\n\nCollege: When you go, it's like you reboot life. You WILL discard most of your friends, or at least put them on the back burner, you CAN be anyone you want to be. You DONT want to pick up any new drugs\/alcohol once you get there if you aren't used to it already or this wonderful gift of people who know NOTHING about you is ruined if you get trashed and look like an idiot.\n\nAnother thing about women: Go on google, read shit about cooking\/baking\/cleaning house, actually be capable of taking care of yourself and her. If she comes into a dorm room with smudged windows and a filthy bed because you take your laundry home to Mom monthly, your getting nowhere because she won't feel comfortable in your room, especially not naked in ur filthy sheets.\n\nOpen Mindedness: Every social group you see feels the same about all the other social groups, awkward and apprehensive.

I believe they go out of their way to break compatibility with devices that aren't officially supported. It's not exactly Microsoft's fault, but it is related to the proprietary, closed-source paradigm.\n\nAs for the gamepads, that's a Microsoft problem. Since Vista it seems like they have been trying their hardest to break as many gamepads as possible. I think it may be related to trying to stop the unauthorized use of game controllers like wiimotes; however, this could just be an indirect way to encourage the sale of devices such as xbox360 controllers for windows. Vista changed the way analog sticks have been processed since Windows 95. Obviously, proprietary Microsoft devices are going to be the first to be fully compatible, stable and functional with the new gamepad stack.\n\nI don't think any gamepad manufactured in the last year or two is explicitly incompatible with Windows, but most gamepads made in the last year or two are not as nice as gamepads that I have been using for years.\n\nedit: if anyone who knows more about Microsoft can shed some light on this topic, or prove me wrong, this would eliminate one of the few gripes I have against windows--from a consumer's point of view.

There were so many other great games and I wasted so much time with that console.  The only thing that really sucked about the DC was the controller -- that was a joke.\n\nIf it wasn't for XBMC on Xbox the DC would have stayed my favorite console (but seeing how I used my xbox and xbmc more for media than games, I guess the DC was my favorite console for playing games).","c0cy11s":"alot of these were random old games have been ported to the xbox homebrew scene if your interested.","c0cy1bs":"It's not me that's being short-sighted.

Currently, infrastructure doesn't exist to support streaming hd video on demand to the same number of people who use rentals, satellite and cable. And companies aren't in any hurry to build it either.\n\nBut all that being what it is, I was talking about a dream of a video store, not a dream of some ultimate uber-reality.

I am still probably not interested, but it's no longer for the reasons I stated above.\n\nBasically form factor has limitations.  These limitations are a human thing.  For example, I don't want to play WoW on a small screen and without a keyboard.  It's a human thing.  I realize that technically I could play WoW on even a 1 inch screen, but I just don't want to.  Games are supposed to be fun.\n\nFrankly I even get tired of my PSP\/Nintendo DSi too...  I play them only when I run out of PS3\/xbox360 games to play.  Like right now.  There's been a game drought for the past 3 months.  There are no good games to play on the real game consoles.  So I play all the good games on the handhelds, but only because there is nothing on PS3.  If there was a great game for PS3, I'd drop my PSP in a second and grab the PS3 controller.  Why?  Because I like my 40\" HDTV and my nice comfy chair.  It's a human thing.  It has nothing to do with tech limitations.\n\nBut... as far as money goes, you are right.  If I can spend a one time fee to purchase a server for my own desktop and then I can play on an iPhone, that's something I will not disregard solely based on the fee structure (I will then probably disregard it for the reason above).\n\nWhat I really want is a good game.  That's what I want.\n\nEDIT: Just looked at the youtube comments now, and they mirror my sentiments here.  That's why the rating on that video is so low.

FF7 is nigh-unplayable, though Mario 64 holds up ok (probably because Mario has a more cartoony style).  I occasionally break out some PS2 3-d games, but they're a definite step down from my xbox and 360 games.\n\ntl;dr: buy it, it's a fun game and still \"works\".","c0d19hf":"It can be done, but Microsoft xbox's division doesn't want to provide software for competing systems.  They want you to have to buy the xbox, and particularly the latest model.","c0d19qy":"You can makeup numbers if you want, but last i checked the xbox live 720p content is at least 6.8mbps which is much better than 250kpbs (by orders of magnitude).

It's a better console.  The console is already a closed, proprietary piece of toy hardware.  xbox360 is just as closed and proprietary as PS3.  PS3 has a tolerable defect ratio though and doesn't cost anything per year to play online.\n\nI hate all the DRM crap as much as you, but I love gaming, and I am going to ignore my righteousness to some degree in order to play some games.  Unfortunately PC gaming scene has been a little stagnant.  One would hope indie games would pick up where the industry left off, but that hasn't been the case, unfortunately.\n\nMicrosoft is just as in-bed with the Hollywood as any other company.  It's all the same crap.  Yes Sony did a very evil thing with the BR format, I agree.\n\nI don't own a single Blue Ray movie.  But I do have many PS3 games.  I don't see any warnings or any of that stuff that people complain about when I play PS3 games.  I enjoy my games on BlueRay without the offensive warnings and unskippable crap.  All that extra crap is only tacked onto the movies and not games.\n\nUpvoting you for truth and great justice.","c0d1dr8":"You're fucking crazy.  xbox360 is in no way better.

Tell me that doesn't illustrate the trend right there.","c0d1etp":"Streaming to an xbox is way better than just nice. I've been running TVERSITY on a vista machine which I threw all of my files on and it is awesome. I've got some streaming radio shows setup that I can play on my 360 also. If my machine was faster it could transcode anything including HD MKVs to the 360. (HD requires a decent quadcore, dual core intel will do most sd files) It really is incredible. It works with any other UPNP type head unit you connect up to a tv.","c0d1hu7":"You again..  i never said HD Content = BluRay. Infact the only thing bluray is, is a freaking laser and a standard codec &amp; app framework.  BluRay != HD, BluRay = Media. \r\n\r\nBTW, i dont' have cable. I was speaking about on demand services like hulu for basic tv, fox\/cbs\/nbc.com for 480p\/720p streaming as well as itunes, xboxlive and zune marketplace amongst many other choices available. I use Windows Media center with dual ATSC tuners for OTA programming and bittorrent &amp; zune for shows, movies and other services i can't get easily through xboxlive - which has Netflix &amp; its own on demand.\r\n\r\nI can pause, ffwd, rewind everything i get on demand in xboxlive. not sure what you're talking about.","c0d1krf":"&gt;i never said HD Content = BluRay.\r\n\r\nBy saying this:\r\n&gt; would be willing to bet there are more people with access to on demand HD content then there are people who own BD players so i'm not sure your statement holds much water.\r\n\r\nYou equated the two.  You claimed, directly, that people using on-demand HD content are competing with people going with Blu-Ray.  It's a worthy discussion to discuss whether digital downloads and streaming technologies will one day, in the far future, compete with Blu-Ray.  But right now, they're entirely different ballparks.  The On Demand HD stuff is all low-quality product.  There's extremely limited selection, and almost all of the implementations are dogshit.  They don't compare to very high bitrate h264 video with 5.1 surround (or better) audio with multiple language tracks, commentaries, extras, and all that other junk they stick on the disc.  People might very well in the future still watch movies on On Demand... but it will likely be crappy movies that they're not sure about.  Anything they are certain will be good, they would likely opt for something higher quality.  A lot of the people who have invested in an HD set and a surround system in the past 5 years want to recreate a theater experience in their home.  All of the services you listed fall very, very, very short of even coming close.\r\n\r\nI have a similar setup, I have an HTPC and I use some of the services you mention.  They look horrible.  720p h.264 MKVs are nice to download and easy to watch.  Anything in 480p is necessarily fuzzy.  Netflix is usually on the very lower border of what I would even call acceptable.  If I am watching something like a comedy show, it's tolerable.  But I could never watch anything that was created by a good director trying to convey a powerful message to his audience.  It would demean him and rob me of the experience he meant to deliver.\r\n\r\nIf Internet connectivity is ever treated like a public utility, as I believe it needs to be, then things will change.  Until then, however, none of the legal options will be worth much.  Because the same people providing Internet also provide the On Demand, they will squeeze their customers as hard as they can to drive them away from online businesses and to their own On Demand services.\r\n\r\nIt may actually end up that you are right, sadly.  The ISPs may retain their grip on our connections and squeeze us.  And the public may choose to just bend over and take it, settling for the piss-poor quality delivered by the services that survive online like hulu.  It certainly wouldn't be the first time that a significantly inferior technology won out.  It would protect the theaters for awhile longer.\r\n\r\n&gt;I can pause, ffwd, rewind everything i get on demand in xboxlive. not sure what you're talking about.\r\n\r\nI'm talking about tomorrow.","c0d1o6o":"Well, after going out and purchasing a second xbox for my folks (Yeah yeah, this is a PS3 thread, blah, blah, blah) I'm more under the impression that you can get more people interested in a system once you start showing the media player implementations of it (Something that the PS3 does fairly well (Not extremely well, I have podcast issues on my PS3, not my 360 though)) and people reallise just how much it is capable of.  Show how nice a bluray movie is, download some videos and show off that aspect, stream audio playlists from your computer.  If a person isn't interested in games, bludgeoning them with games won't work.  People are interested in watching things on tv though, and if they get the feeling that they will be superior to their friends if they only had product X, they will warm up to it quicker.","c0d1q38":"That's awful.... what is worse is i have an ex doing time for murder (he was tried as a juvenile)  but he got 4 years, and he has internet access \"cabins\" and an xbox 360 sounds more like an awesome get away than a punishment right? of course it does esp. being treated like that!","c0d2915":"&gt; what is the relation between Milton Friedman with the Chicago school and the Austrian school?\n\nIn a sentence? Friedman and Chicago Schoolers and the Austrians both believe that money should exist, trade and barter are the system not imposed upon man, but \"birthed\" in a way, via emergent spontaneous order (like language). They are both \"capitalist\", in that they believe in \"property\" and think people may own xbox360s, cars, and a house. That really is about the end of the similarity. After that, they are completely different.\n\n&gt; where do they differ? \n\nMethodology (which is kind of an academic term for \"in every way\", heh), see above for more on that, or specifically, the Praxeology link.\n\n&gt; is it fair to say the Chicago school is a subset of the Austrian?\n\nNot at all. It is *literally* as wrong as saying that economists that advocate stimulus spending (as opposed to something else like demurrage, incentivization, currency competition ,etc) are communists. Both communists and people advocating a stimulus bill in the US are \"distributing\", right? ... so why wouldn't Bernanke be a communist? Having heard many people point out the complete incorrectness of thinking that, I'm sure, you know that to be somewhat ridiculous. Dr. Bernanke is no more a communist or socialist than Friedman or Laffer are Austrians.\n\nThat may be the best way to explain it.","c0d2gtt":"I think there's an xbmc extension for Justin.Tv  \n\nI usually scour sites for good feeds and then make a streaming .asx file and use my xbox to watch it on my TV.

Once I had a quality dvd collection of 300 to 350 films. Then I started streaming 700mb and iso's to xbmc on my xbox, now I've evolved to straming 1080p bluray rips to my tv through my pch a110. Sold my dvds on for about $1.20 each in bulk. Lost a lot of money. Kept my top 10. I know im getting off point but great films will always be great.

Smart playlists are the obvious one, but also categorizing music so i can press 1 button and shuffle my entire collection, without holiday music. And i never, ever have to update a single playlist file. \n\nAnd with computers, I've basically stopped building them myself. I use the ps3 and xbox for gaming, and I use a mac book pro for interwebs. I hook that up to a 24\" monitor when I want to get some programming done. \n\nBasically, that just became one of those black holes of time that I didn't feel was necessary anymore. ","c0d2ovr":"Had it on two computers, and an xbox.  Seven characters 30+, but never actually beat the game.  Leeeet meeeee quiiiiiiiiiit.","c0d2txe":"Good question! Main reasons: \n\n* For lack of a better word, I got... bored. Opening the business, advertising, expanding, etc were the challenging parts. The computer work (repairing computers, xbox 360s, networking businesses, etc) was easy. Though I enjoy business, I enjoy the technology aspect much more. I'm about to finally finish my Computer Science degree and I've done programming freelance since I was about 15. I just kind of felt like my talents were wasted and it's hard to stay motivated when all the repairs were so easy.\n\n* My business partner and I were about to murder each other with hammers. We both felt like the other needed to do more in certain areas when truthfully we should have both worked more. We both probably worked less than 35 hours a week on average. The boiling point came right before we closed. He went on vacation for a week and I worked about an 80 hour week trying to catch up and make sure everything got done. I went on vacation for a week about a month later and I don't think he spent more than a couple hours actually working that week. I flipped shit and said, \"fuck it, we're closing this place down by the end of the month (which was a terrible idea).\n\n* Stress, though this wasn't too big of a deal. As badass as it is to be the boss and do whatever the fuck you want, it can be nice to have a boss too. If a web design client was upset because some text was 2px off, I had to deal with them and their stupidity. I could never make up some excuse and pass it off to my boss because he didn't exist. You tend to think about that stuff at home as well instead of just leaving it at work.","c0d2zeb":"A billion spoilers, and also forgive me if I get something wrong as I played Braid like a year ago:\n\nThe atomic bomb, as worked on by Tim, is a central theme of the story, if not the gameplay. There's nothing terribly hard to grasp about that, once you know it, and explains the wall of fire chasing you on the princess\/knight level, as well as the various indications Tim is a scientist.\n\nIt's also rather heavily suggested that Tim is a pretty messed up dude, and has had one or more completely fucked relationships (See: the wedding ring, ) due probably in part to his working on\/being obsessed with the bomb. Taken this way the game is a psychological journey where he comes to terms with this via the princess\/knight epiphany and starts rebuilding his life (the castle at the very end).

I was prompted to submit this after reading an article about a 27 year old who has never kissed anyone.  I thought it was odd that a newspaper would find interest in such a topic, especially since I didn't think a case like mine was so rare.  Is it really that rare?\n\nIf so, then it has to be a combination of weird factors that has led me to this \"strange\" existence.  High school has an easy explanation.  I had maybe 1 friend.  I would often sit in the cafeteria by myself to eat.  I tried hanging out with the pokemon card players, but the stuff they did never interested me.  I guess they never thought I was interesting either.  The cool kids ignored me except senior year when they'd copy all my homework because I was the only one still doing them.  Even the Christian kids didn't care to include me....how sad is that?  \n\nIn college, people were a lot nicer to me.  I got involved with a few social groups and lived with decent roommates.  Maybe it was because of the shitiness of high school, but I developed a philosophy to be non-discriminatory to everyone.  I was attracted to some women, but I thought that to act on it was unfair.  I didn't like the notion of judging someone by her level of attractiveness to ask her out on a date.  And no female ever asked me out on a date.  My roommates assumed that I didn't date anyone because I had a bad relationship in the past.\n\nGrad school came and is going...I'm just cruising on the same attitude as college.  In fact, a part of my career choice is based on the assumption that I will be single for the rest of my life.  I do get lonely sometimes, but fortunately I have the internet, reddit, and my trusty xbox 360 to keep me busy.  For the most part, I am happy.  I just wish society didn't have to judge people like me for being eternally single.  It's not like I have a psychiatric disorder...trust me I should know with the work I'm going into.  Really, who cares if a 27 year old guy has never kissed a woman before.  \n\nEDIT: I appreciate the supportive comments.  I wonder for those who up-vote if it is because they are just like me, and the people who down-vote because they think \"I'm rationalizing being a pussy.\"  Does it change your perception of me when I tell you that I went to a top 5 college in the US and for a career will spend most of my time interacting with people and saving lives?   \n\nEDIT:  Thought I should post this reply on the \"Pursuit of Happiness\":\nAs for happiness, I don't want to follow what society defines as \"happiness\".  Just because I'm 26 and never have dated should not mean that I am not happy.  In fact, I'm most happy when I give to people who cannot give back anything in return.  I think that my pursuit of happiness is to do international healthcare and getting stuck with dating, marriage, and children will hold me back from my true happiness.  That's what I'm trying to figure out.  But maybe you would say that this goal of mine is reaction-formation, and maybe you are right.\n\nEDIT: Because I'm bombarded by \"happiness is to share dinner with your girlfriend.  With whom to walk around town on a beautiful night,\" I think that somehow I'm missing out on something.  I'm just as happy wandering Paris by myself, or sitting by a river watching a sunset by myself.  Maybe I would be happier with someone sitting next to me.  This hormonal reaction though, what if its as addictive as pot and I find myself needing more of it.  It would take my dream away, make me a less functional person, and make me weak and dependent.

None of them seem to take full advantage of the system, mostly due to cross platform code bases (the xbox has lower res), and devs and tools not up to snuff to deal with the processor.  Plus the games are just typical fare.\n\nHowever, this game however may make the console finally worth it.  I am very excited after watching the demo and now the screenshots.\n\nIf this game is as good as it looks, PS3's will be in short supply for the holidays, that's for sure.","c0d5ae2":"&gt;Better dashboard and O\/S; \n\nI think this is a little subjective.  I like the XMB better than the Microsoft dashboard.  \n\n&gt;It is easier to program for and has more available memory thus cross &gt;platform releases are usually just a little better on the x360.\n\nOne of their biggest strengths is the ability to develop for PC and compile for 360.  (with a few tweaks here and there i'm sure) \n\n&gt;The games library is better for people in North America, \n\nThe library is ok.  PS3 and the 360 have a lot of the same titles but for me the exclusives the PS3 has brings it over the top.  Since Gears of War 2 I did not buy a game for the 360 until RE5 was out.  And even then that was because it was 30 bucks.\n\n&gt;The controller is better, except for the crappy D-pad.\n\nI do like the controller for the xbox better.\n\n&gt;For the longest time the PS3 was 100 dollars more, so that was a &gt;factor for many people.\n\nOr another way of looking at it was that it was the same price as the elite and came with more.   Once it came down to 400 I just didn't see the big deal.\n\n&gt;If all of your friends are using an xbox then you can't play online with &gt;them if you use the PS3.\n\nWith 2\/3 of my 360 owning friends also having a PS3, chances are i'll be getting Modern Warfare 2 for 360 just so all of us can play together.

When i eventually got red ringed i was looking into who to send it to, Microsoft or target. \n\nThe impression i got with target from reading stories online was that you send your console to target tech support and they \"try to fix it\"  voiding the warranty in the process. Many of the stories i read had people complaining that they got their console back, still ringed and in worse shape than when they sent it out, if they got it back at all. Some waited months before getting any kind of response back from target after sending it in.\n\nSo i sent my xbox to Microsoft, got it back in 2 weeks, and it has worked fine ever since.

They are probably worried that people will read a thread where you \"get your way\" and worry that an army of unsatisfied 360 customers will stampede into the forum to get their replacement units.  After all, Microsoft has over a 50% failure rating on those first xbox 360 units.\n\nIf you get too high up in the company, you run into very belligerent people whose job is to insulate the upper management from the unwashed public.\n\nIt's not enough of a clear cut case to go to Consumerist with ... something where you have the correct service plan pamphlet stapled to your receipt, but the receipt indicates you purchased the other service plan.\n\nI avoid the service plans offered by the stores, and stick to those offered by manufacturers, if they exist.

They don't care if doctors are being pressured into prescribing their medication when there might be a better option for the patient.  As long as people buy their medicine, they don't give a fuck if it's being used as advertised, or even if it works at all.\n\nI think it's absolutely unacceptable for a business to fuck with the health of their consumers like that.  I think they immediately lose the right to advertise when their marketing does more harm than good.  \n\nOnce you get to the point where your advertising lets the doctor know enough about your medication to make an educated decision about how to best treat his or her patient, the only result past that which you can possibly hope to get from your advertising is to convince the consumer to pressure their doctor into prescribing them medication based on what information they've gathered from a 30-second commercial.

Stick it in a metal game case and call random artwork \"bonus\" content and get the money right off the bat. #2 DLC: Remove content, sell it back later (i dont care what they tell the public, they are removing content pre-release with the full intention of making it DLC).

Also, the Blu-Ray drive is apparently reads much slower than the DVD drive on the 360 which is why games have to install to the hard disk. I learned a lot from posting this question even if the PS3 fanboys down voted me. I purposely didn't mention the 360 in my post cause I didn't want to start a fan boy war.

Boot time is still a bit of an issue - it uses a 2.5\" HDD to keep it quiet, so it's not all that fast. I'll be throwing in an SSD when the prices approach sensible numbers, though.\n\nBeen meaning to look into Boxee, and there are some hardware players out there that look good like..

Run whatever programs you want on windows - Microsoft doesn't have a say in it.  You don't have to download an \"installer\" from Microsoft, or submit your app for approval.\n\nIf Microsoft made your computer system, would you be fine with them decide what applications can be developed for it?  How about which websites you can visit?  (imagine a world like that: \"why yes, bing.com is on the approved list.  Guess what isn't?\")  Things like the xbox and things like the iphone show that many people ARE happy with that.  I'm not one of them.  It makes me sad to see the phones going down that same path where the company says \"I made the hardware, I decide which applications you may run\".\n\nJailbroken iphones are systems that work - until the next security update comes out - then they don't work anymore.  That seems unsatisfactory to me.","c0drr3u":"or find an used xbox and install xbmc.","c0drsa7":"&gt; Jailbroken phones work just fine- just don't update them. There is nothing forcing an update.\n\nThat's why I included that key word \"security\".  Although I suppose there's another way you might prefer - if there's a security hole, the vendor can just disable all the apps that might hit it!\n\nThe website thing is partially a joke - and partially not.  Since the systems used on websites have their own set of security problems (as we recently saw!), why would the attitude \"we have to secure all applications\" not become \"we have to secure all websites\".  And after all, whitelists are much more secure than blacklists.\n\nYou see, it's not the implementation I'm arguing (although that's atrocious too).  It's the philosophy.\n\nBut let's talk about your examples.\n&gt; Remember needing to insert the CD every time you wanted to play a game?\n...\n&gt; I put the goddam game THAT I RENTED into my XBox and it plays.\n\nHmm.  You seem to be extolling the same method you're attacking.  The only reason I knew of to crack most (purchased) games was to avoid that whole \"put the game in the drive\" thing.\n\nAs for the \"stupid fucking keys\", well, that's just now built into your hardware isn't it?  That closed system has much more invasive DRM, along with the next greater evil version - online revocation.  A price you're willing to pay?\n\nCertificates... there are many reasons why the concept of manual cert verification failed (at least for your grandma).  But yes, verification of the identity of the author of the thing you're downloading is a necessary evil when you can download from anywhere.  You don't need to worry about that on your xbox - because again, that invasive DRM is sitting there helpfully doing allllllll that for you.  You just have to pay the tax - ein vendor, ein reich, ein... damn.  I almost lost Godwin's law. :-(\n\n\nAnyway, the middle ground between \"a phone you can't install ANY apps to\" and \"a computer you (accidentally) install spyware on\" should not be \"a phone that apple (or palm) decides which apps you install\".\n","c0drtob":"yeh a used xbox from 2002 isn't like an eye soar or anything, get one of those - it will be just like your living back in the dorm again dood!","c0ds0jw":"too much money (xbox) for 2 scenes","c0ds1qd":"Sounds like it.

They are charging the same price for both.\n\nAll games cost money, I never said they should be free. I never used the words magical amazing features you imbecile. What I was walking about, was Valve's consistent support for their games. For example, \n\nThe Orange Box\n-Half Life 2, Episode 1 and 2\n-team Fortress 2\n-Portal\n\nAll of this is 30 dollars, and you get constant support such as new maps, new items and weapons on a regular basis absolutely free.\n\nHalo ODST\n=&gt; A new short campaign for the ODST, yes its original\n=&gt; Firefight Mode (Note its just a mode, not a new MP experience)\n=&gt; halo Reach beta access (btw this is freely provided in games in the past)\n=&gt; All halo 3 maps including the new ones, which most Halo players have already downloaded and payed for anyways, except for the newest ones.\n\nAll of this for 60 dollars, not to mention 50 dollars a year just to be able to play online. Can you honestly argue with THIS?\n\nAnd finally, you seem to imply that the new single player from ODST is all great, and that it is much better than the item\/map\/gamemode additions from valve.\n\nThis is simply ridiculous, let us weigh in on this. Lets compare the Additions from Bungie and the additions from valve.\n\nOn Bungie's side:\n1: One short single player campaign\n2: One MP gamemode\n3:3 new maps for Halo 3 multiplayer\n\nPrice for these features==&gt; 60 US dollars\n\nValve:\n=&gt; New maps added on a regular basis for free, new maps such as Sawmill as an example\n=&gt; New gamemodes added on a regular basis, such as King of the Hill most recently\n==&gt; new items+Class updates change both gameplay and substance on a regular basis\n\nAll of this continued support absolutely for free, no annual xboxlive bullshit, no micropayments and no bullshit expansions.\n\nAnd as a last note, I did not combine Half life with team fortress as you did in your post, and if we did, that wouold simply support my argument even more.\n\nAnything else? This is irrefutable proof that you get more content from valve than Bungie, and its free, thats not magic, thats called a EXCELLENT GAME DEVELOPER. ","c0ds516":"Silverlight? Wow that sucks.

Anyway i have EVERY SINGLE oblivion + DLC achievement, logged over 6 days of play time over multiple characters... basically, i have been there and done that when it comes to oblivion so if you have any specific questions ask away...\n\nTips... well that depends on what KIND of character you want to make, but i will outline the basics \n\nYour primary skills are CRITICAL to your character because only they contribute towards increasing your level, and naturally thats important.\nNow some others have sudgested that you take skills that are easy to level up... well thats good advice, yet bad advise at the same time, let me clarify: The monsters in this game level up as you level up, same as in fallout III, their stats and damage increase just like yours, but if you leveled up by making a few thousand potions with the alchemy skill, then your combat skills haven't increased at the same rate as the monsters you will be fighting. So in the first few levels easy leveling is great, however once you pass 10 or so levels that way, you will, start feeling the effects of an underdeveloped character. keep that in mind when creating your character.\n\nSkills i would NEVER recommend you take:\n\nSecurity - as stated in other comments, once you completely a certain quest you get an unbreakable lock pick... making the skill completely useless.\n\n(Hand to hand) Unarmed - The whole monk\/karate character is a great idea and i have tried a few variants, but the main problem is that in later levels unarmed just cant compete with blade\/blunt\/destruction in terms of offensive damage\n\nAcrobatics - this one makes you jump higher\/take less damage from falls... oblivion is kinda a flat place, not very may high drops so it basically makes you jump higher. You do eventual get a combat roll that is semi useful but its not worth a primary skill slot, just jump around a lot and level it up as a secondary ** this is one of those easy level up skills i wouldn't recommend you take.  \n\nMost magical skills - i only ever use Destruction, restoration and alchemy, i personal find that most other magical skills are not all that useful later on, they are kind of finicky and eventual i almost always just end up not using them on my mages\n\nMerchantile - cheep goods! why not i have an empty slot anyway! .... NO! NO! NO! unless you trade THOUSAND UPON THOUSANDS of items this is impossible to level up, and basically completely wastes a primary slot, the price reduction isn't even that much considering the loot you get as time go's on increases exponential in value, you may save 10000 gold by the time you reach level 20 or so, but by level 25 some items can go for twice that...each\n\nSkills i would highly recommend: \n\nONE* weapon based combat skill, ie Blade, blunt, marksman. taking multiple inst really feasible, as you will end up just using one, switching weapons becomes annoying. also avoid thinking that you can take blade and marksman and switch according to the area\/monsters... it wont last, trust me its just impossible in most dungeons as enemy's will jump out at you etc and you need to be ready (not switching weapons, although with hotkeys its not that much of an issue) plus you will probably just end up preferring one\n\n*destruction - even though you may not be a mage\/spellcaster if you have an open slot, throw in destruction, it takes up your unused magic slot, and if you are a mage then its your primary offensive skill *note some enemy's in later levels are IMMUNE to physical attacks, this saves you from being a level 40 something warrior running from some pathetic ghost that you cant damage because your weapon is out of magical charge etc*\n\nSpeechcraft - now if you have an extra slot, throw in speechcraft. as in fallout III having that little bit of extra speechcraft skill can save you from doing whole mind numbing errands for quests, its worth it for your mental sanity, also, it can make the game alot more fun to play as you get really role play\n\nGeneral notes:\n\nBlade is better than blunt, not so much that its unbalanced, its just that AMAZING blunt weapons are hard to come by, swords are just a lot more common, most of my blunt characters seem to get hundreds of amazing, yet useless blade weapons \n\nIf you take blade\/heavy armor\/light armor\/blunt... TAKE ARMORER!! In the later levels enemies cast spells that break your weapons and armor, nothing is worse then being 40 min into a dungeon only to have your weapons break down, and watch as enemies you would normal not even bother to pay attention to, kill you again and again\n\nIf you want a non-cheat way to level up your sneak skill, look for NPC's doing actions that dont let them move, ie the farmers outside of towns or people sitting in chairs, just go behind them and sneak back and forth ... it levels up your sneak skill very very fast although its kinda boring \n\nAlchemy is useless as a primary IMO, but DONT ignore it as a secondary! the name escapes me atm but the town just below the capital has a vine yard and a farm outside of it, steal the hundreds of grapes and crops, make potions, wait for them to re grow, repeat, this **makes alot of potions and guess what...you can sell them...for ridiculous amounts of easy GOLD** \n\nMy personal favorite character type is:\nBlade,\nBlock,\nArmorer,\nHeavy Armor, \nAthletics (increases stamina regeneration),\n*open* usually speechcraft (or whatever i feel like experimenting with),\n*open* destruction\n\n\nPRO TIP******* when you do the sewers entry mission, save RIGHT before you leave and finalize your character, that way you can skip the boring intro (i have seen it a hundred times, its good the first few though) and make test characters to see what you like the most! just leave it as its own save and bingo, making new characters is easy as can be!\n\nPS if you follow the main story line out of the sewers and go to (forget name) the blades guy in the Abby who you give the amulet to, one of his dialoge options will be assistance, click it and he will unlock a chest full of very very nice low level goddies for you, its not much but it boosts your early level gear dramatically, also once you join the fighers guild you can legally take most of the stuff in their halls, scattered throughout the halls is full steel heavy armor, not bad for a level 1 character eh?\n\nWow sorry that was so long...i just really love that game... got a bit carried away\n","c0e1ea5":"Sorry I prefer computers.

I was skeptical. I had the same questions. Then we pulled into the RV lot.\n\nImagine burning man, without the self important assholes trying to make some inane \"statement\" or foist their \"art\" upon you. It's Friday, your RV is loaded with beer and grill food and you're some of the last people to show up. You get to your spot, the parking guys help you set it up so you have the optimal amount of space to set up your grill, lawn darts and beach tents for when it rains. The grass is too long, but that's no big deal, some guy brought a lawnmower and will clear out your 20'x40' for twenty bucks. All weekend you throw a frisbee, lawn golf, whatever, grill and drink to your heart's content. Guys come around to pump out your septic and keep you stocked with ice and water. Your instant neighbors come by, everyone friendly, asking about where you're from. Some of them, being executive chefs at New Orleans cajun restaurants, make you the best seabass and jambalaya you've ever had, expecting absolutely nothing in return except your enjoyment of their efforts. Generators power TVs where people are playing xbox or watching football on giant TVs. Some crazy guy on a minibike is tearing around the lots, until he decides to loan it the oldtimer who promptly makes him look like a wimp for not popping wheelies. Bonfires in controlled pits roar at every site. People light off fireworks all night, to the cheers of all nearby.\n\nOn race day, you pack your 14\"x14\" cooler and head for the track (so long as it can fit under your seat, you can bring as much beer as you want). You can rent headsets to hear the radio traffic amongst the racers and their pit crews, and watch camera angles from all over. They finish up the introductions, the cars come out of the pits and arrange themselves into their slotted positions. They do a few laps at 60-80 mph to get everyone set. It's loud, but not much worse than driving with the windows down. Then the pace car peels off in turn 4, and half a second before the green flag goes up, 40 cars in two lanes just inches from one another simultaneously go from 60 to 140 mph in about three seconds. The noise goes from sorta loud to instantly deafening without earplugs in the front 10 rows, and you can't help but say to yourself, *holy shit these guys are hauling ass.*\n\nI won't lie, it's not that spectacular for all 400 or whatever laps. Like a lot of sports, there's ebbs and flows. A couple of crashes and caution flags can make your mind wander for a few minutes (but you don't miss the restarts!). Then again, a tight battle between two contenders at the front of the pack for several laps can grab your attention. And if you're lucky, you get a pretty spectacular crash that (fortunately!) the driver walks away from.\n\nI left that weekend with some great memories of a rollicking good time. I can't say I'm an instant convert and a diehard, but I definitely see the appeal. I'd say if you want to find out, and get the most out of it, get some friends, rent an RV, pack it with food and beer, make a long weekend out of it, and go in with an open mind. Depending on where you go (there are plenty of races in states north of Mason-Dixon) you'll meet any range of assholes, but that's no different than any sporting event you might visit. You're also liable to meet a lot of really friendly, nice, down to earth folks who are happy to share some BBQ or a beer with you (or a makeshift slip and slide made from a tarp during one night of warm, driving rain). And you're likely to then understand the appeal.","c0e2brs":"usually when i forget things and they are way far away, i just say fuck it.\n\nonce i was stoned and left xbox games behind. in another state.","c0e2icl":"Don't Care about xbox live moron.

It was naturally assumed there would be a delay because of the transition period, but he is well past that now. He was elected because of the messages he ran on - \"*real* change in Washington\".\n\nMost people, myself included, took that to mean no more back room deals, no more sweetheart appropriations, or peddling of influence. But judging by actions - not his words - nothing of consequence *has* changed. True, some populous measures were passed - such as the waterboarding memorandum - but those were a false dilemma. Continuing the practice would have been so massively unpopular **nobody** could take that position, whatever party they came from.\n\nYet with the measures that will actually cause some initial sting and will be initially unpopular among some, but fix things in the long run, he is taking no action. He is trying to lead by example perhaps (hopefully he won't take 2\/3 of his term off on vacation, like the last one), but as long as situations continue to arise - like the healthcare reform turning into a sickly mess, flat out *waffling* - we're just alternating between two sides of the same coin.

The issue there is that that process is fairly slow and that the next step on that isn't going to occur until October 22. At that point I start to run into problems with getting through certification with Microsoft and then getting manufactured in time in order to make November 17.\n\n&gt;\"We are going to continue to go down that path.

It feels like we just lost one of the greatest thing PC gaming had going for it.  We're going to have to share with xbox 360, and console owners are used to getting screwed like that, and having to buy sequels for 50 dollars when they should be expansion packs, only because the hardware in the xbox 360 is too limited to actually have an expansion pack of any kind of serious nature.","c0e57eq":"I see your thread and raise you one rrod article\n\nhttp:\/\/gizmodo.com\/5376275\/insanity-xbox-360-repaired-3-times-returns-each-time-with-red-ring","c0e59bt":"Ok, I really hope you will read this comment...\nI've been a 360 owner for the past year and half. I'v loved it.  But I recenlty got a new PC and every game I can play on the Xbox, I can play on the PC with less lagg, modds, (\"try before you buy ...hehe\") and better graphics.  Almost every game that comes out for the xbox comes out for the PC.\n\nIn terms of price, you really shouldn't compair.  Sure PS3 is $300 and xbox is a bit cheaper, but i've come to see that this isn't true in the long run.  I've spend an extra $100 on live, and with the RRoD and wireless issues...its just pissing me off more and more.  \n\nReally what  I think you should do is get a upgrade your PC a bit to make the newer games run better and invest in a PS3.  Although the PS3 has a smaller library of \"good games\", remember your PC will make up for that.  Plus, you can use an xbox controller with the PC if you really wish.   \n\n\nAs of now I'm going to sell my xbox, buy L4D2 on PC, and buy a PS3.  The newer games coming out (Heavy rain and GoW3) are just too great for me to pass up.  Plus, don't hold me to this, i'm sure you can install an operating system on a PS3 (or maybe the older ones.)  With this, snag a copy of Win7 rc and you got nextflix to you tv.

I liked it myself but a few things to think about:\n\n1 - The story has 10 years from development to full install base of billions is far from likely. This is really not even feasible and there was no need to rush it. should of been more like 40-50 years if not longer..\n\n2 - Cost.. these are very complicated systems with many support components you need to install at home (charger, chair, display and core computer) not to mention the realistic skin and faces. To have any large install base the cost would have to be under 1k which is itself impossible as any single piece of the system alone would be many thousands..  \n\n3 - Crime rate drops. This made no sense. If you ever played xbox live or any online 'sandbox' game you already know the first week someone would be killing\/robbing and tea-bagged. 'operators' would be like avatars in online games, running around doing everything they shouldn't so this came off as very bad writing. With everything else they did get right - to get this wrong seems to me inexcusable.  \n\n4 - They didn't go into any detail how you move in your surrogate.. I mean in the matrix you have a fucking cable in your brain, here it is just the use of your retinas... I wish they showed how this works more..\n\nOutside of these issues I love the premise and overall look and feel.  Like in the Matrix it had a green hue.. Surrogates were easy to pick out in their movement and expressions, esspecially when they would leave their connection to go to bathroom which gave the movie more depth and reality. It really felt like they were machines. They did a fantastic job in acting and makeup.  \n\nI am a professional software engineer who works from home many years now.

Something about it makes the words 'fuck', 'fag', and 'homo' sit just on the tip of their tongue.  They're liberated to act like internet tough guys, but their balls haven't dropped; their voices are a dead give away.  So, they over compensate with a flurry of swears.  \n\nI remember, sometime ago, I thought I was enjoying a game of Halo2(I was mistaken, fyi) when a little shit tard came on and asked everyone politely if they had an extra xbox live free month give away code they could have.  When they realized no one was going to give them everything they morphed into little balls of swearing fury! \"You're a fag, FAG!\" etc. etc. etc.\n\nI can't stand this.  When I was a kid playing quake or tf, I never dreamed of being so bothered that I'd just start insulting everyone.  So, when a kid does feel the need to use all three of their swear's, I fire back.  I say the nastiest, most foul thing I can think of to cripple their maturing minds.  \"I fucked your mother so hard last night she shit the bed!\" (Every time you mention their mother they all come back with the \"she's dead\" routine, to which you should reply with an enthusiastic, \"I know!\") \n\nIf you do it right, they'll get bothered enough to attract a parent to swat you down.  At this moment I usually call out their parenting and tell them they've raised a socially awkward, spiteful asshole.  \n\nI guess the point I'm trying to make is that it's useless to insult back at kids, but if you can get their parents! Well, that's when the fun really starts.  ","c0e64uj":"If you have a friend with an xbox 360 (and an xbox Live Gold account, with some friends who play), just try it.  You'll see what i'm talking about.  As soon as you turn on your console you can instantly see every game that your friends are playing, or whatever else they might be doing (like watching a netflix movie).  You can jump into their party and do your own thing while they play, but you still have the ability to talk to them.  You can jump directly into their game if you want, etc.  You can even watch the same movie together or share photos etc., all sync'ed up and chatting the entire time.\n\nYou can do one or two of these things on ps3, but the ps3 is very me-too design for online features... all tacked on, and not thought out the way xbox live is.  But like another user was saying here, if you don't care about friends\/online, ps3 is a great system.  But if you DO care about playing with your friends, to say the ps3 has even remotely similar features in terms of USABILITY and EASE is simply lying, or they don't know what they are talking about.","c0e64z7":"Not only is it not smooth, its nearly impossible unless that specific game supports it.  It's not a unified online architecture the way xbox live is.","c0e655x":"The fact that xbox has had this since launch (for 1 on 1 chat) and over a year for party chat exemplifies the unfriendliness of the ps3 for communal gaming.  Sony simply did not think about an actual online community the way MS with xbox live did...

Keys are for typing, not controlling characters.\n\n-Buttons are much more distinct\/reliable than keys for actions.\n\n-Triggers more realistically emulate a gun. Have fun with your mouse buttons.\n\n-Rumble, bitch!\n\n-Everybody has the same controller, removes variability. For example, I know that when I beat somebody in Halo or COD4, I am better than them. When I kill someone in CS, it might be because I have a better mouse or keyboard.

I was too young to drive at the time, and it was a Saturday so my mom drove me.  At the time they were offering $10 a game no matter what, so I brought the system and the 13 games I had collected.  Before I could be payed the system had to be tested, so the black lady plugged it into the large screen tv behind the counter that was visible from everywhere in the store.  I was just standing there nonchalantly waiting to get paid, when she grabs the first game in the stack.  It was the game that came with the xbox, Tetris\/Stars Wars Something.  I hadn't played that game since the first month of owning the system, so I didn't think anything of it.  The game loads up and gets to the profile select screen.  I look over and in big capital letters it says, \"NIGGA DICK!\".... I have never tried so hard not to laugh while being scared out of my mind.  Luckily, she didnt say a word and my mom was on the other side of the store looking at dvd's.  So I got my $180 and GTFO.","c0e8nzu":"I used a LOT of the HTPC software out there from windows media center to myth tv to sage tv, and others, and what I've been happiest with is mediamall playon, a PS3\/xbox360, and tversity.  I've also been having a lot of luck with the java based ps3mediaserver software.  tversity and ps3mediaserver are free, but playon requires a one time $40 investment.  It is WELL worth it.  I turned off my cable TV and save about $80 a month.\r\n\r\nNote that this ONLY works if you don't plan to record things off cable.  Between the content available on mediamall playon such as hulu, CNN, etc. and the things I download(ahem), I never run out of content.  If you decide to go this way send me a message and I'll send you some plugins for playon that stretches out past 1000s of shows all available online for free!  I can also give you some pointers on where to get TV online.\r\n\r\nMythTV is awesome, but very difficult to set up.  Make sure that you have the right hardware for the job.  You'll need a video card and processor that can handle encoding and decoding video to the standard of your TV (HDTV or SD) and a fairly large hard drive.  You can get a 1.5TB hard drive for $110 that should serve you well for pretty much any kind of content you're after.\r\n\r\nThe MythTV forums and various chat rooms are invaluable in helping you to solve problems, but be sure to read all available documentation before asking questions.\r\n\r\nIf you're not a tech type, I'd highly recommend Tivo, which you can now run from your PC with a package from Nero.  This will enable you do most of what MythTV is capable in a very streamlined way, but the disadvantage is that there is a monthly fee to use the guide service (myth TV does provide this for free, but sometimes the service is down or has issues and this is a REAL pain)\r\n\r\nAlso there is boxee, which runs on a PC or apple tv, is free, and has an awesome 10 foot interface that I found sorely lacking in windows media center.\r\n\r\nSo to sum up, only go with Myth if you're into tinkering with hardware and software.  If you are good with linux, I felt that the linux software worked a lot better than the windows build, but things may have changed since I installed it a few years ago.  Once it is set up, it is AMAZING and very powerful.","c0e8ob5":"&gt;look at the black dude we elected president...

If it's the former than forza probably isn't the game for you, since even in the lower spec classes (racing in mass produced cars) you won't hit breakneck speeds.\n\nIf you don't mind using the breaks and you're main concern is spending hours learning tracks because every time you spin out every time meet a new corner. Then forza is great, like the previous post said it has a bunch of assist mechanics the most useful of which is the racing line. The entire track has a line that is either red (you wont even get to turn), yellow (you'll drift) or dissapears completely (you'll make it around the corner).\n\nThe best part about forza though is the fact it's essentially Gran Turismo for the xbox. It's got a lot of tracks, cars, modifications and events. And when I say events its just like GT, where you'll get to race in everything from street cars to concept cars with variations of how much you can modify them afterwards (out of the factory to all the bells and whistle races).","c0e9s9x":"a lot of my usb plugs also have a little bump or notch or something on the upper side, like my xbox360 controller, so i don't have to look, just do it by touch.  sort of a this-side-up-nub.","c0e9stc":"family guy has gone down hill..and yes, I did like family guy before it became so popular.  Go ahead and doubt me and say what you will, but I've always took pride in the fact that I live by my standards, and no one elses..  I dont need pop culture telling me what is funny before i decide its funny. Guess that's why I own a ps3 and not a 360, although american society dictates 360 is teh best!!!! American society is largely dictated by pop culture.  Halo and xbox made gaming popular and mainstream, okay for everyone instead of just the nerds and dorks, and thus mainstream gaming became cookie cutter hollywood shitfests with mindless explosions and big gruffy men with guns as the norm.  Fuck halo, I will take my Disgaea 3 and Demon's Souls any day.\n\nI got off topic..also, im high.  \n\nAnyway, I agree with the statement about family guy, and especially about stewie.  You see, in american culture, its becoming very commonplace to shove homosexuality down our throats through introducing and plethora of gay characters in everything, including children cartoons, and is especially over saturated in programming targeted to tweens and teenagers.  Changing stewies awesome original and uniquely funny character to a bland stereotype is in accordance to pop culture standard of having homosexuality at least somewhere in almost anything and everything.  It wasn't like this 10 years ago..  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I dont have anything against gays, but i hate having it shoved down my throat in everything, literally..everything.  characters even change to incorporate this into whatever it can be, and thus stewie is gay now, instead of being original and funny..hes just gay, and if you bitch about stewie being gay, the conditioned response is to immediately assume said person is a homophobe because he dislikes the gay character.\n\nYes, family guy has changed, they destroyed stewie to some degree.  He can still be funny, but hes just not the same.  \n\nIts interesting..you know in the bible it says that in the end of days, there will be a rise in homosexuality in society..  never has such a small group of people (gays) have been made into a huge cultural thing, and put into everything to make it seem like its so much more common.  \ni believe this confuses already confused teenagers and takes advantage of the awkward stages of knowing your sexuality to make homosexuality seem like its completely okay, and common, and deserves to be in everything we consume in the media and entertainment.\n\nIm not religious, and i have nothing against homosexuals, im just tired of having to see it everywhere..literally everywhere, like its such a common acceptable thing, when its really not that common..\n\nSociety programs people to think and be a certain way, and most people can't think enough for themselves to not be affected by propaganda, and higher motives and agendas.  Homosexuality is becoming a lot more common now, since homosexuality is indoctrinating our youth through cartoons and tv shows, its becoming a prominent figure in our society even though homosexuality isn't that common, which is now changing due to what we as a society consume.\n\nPeople can be 'brainwashed' or conditioned to be a certain way, there is science behind this, and these tactics are employed by governments all over the world to control the progress of societal ways.\n\nIts sad but true, and most people can't see this, even though its so blatantly clear.\n \nLike I said, 10 years ago it wasn't this bad.  \n\nI will be flooded with downvotes as most of you wont agree with me, or maybe even understand what my point is and what im really trying to say.","c0e9std":"na xbox players are retarded I kick ass on pc and only get kicked when someone wants a friend in lol.","c0e9sya":"Is it important that they come from Reddit?

It's much harder starting now and my gf is kinda in the same boat but learning and now does really well playing.  She can beat my score on house of the dead 3 ;)\n\nPlease don't think this is a troll, but owning a ps3 and a wii, I'd say learn to game on a wii and then go to ps3.  Wii has those old school barebones games we all learned on and will mimic the progression from SNES to N64 (2d to 3d) to ps1 even.  This will help enormously.\n\nI lapsed console gaming at the middle of ps1 cause I hated what new games became (watered down pc games), so I know where you're coming from.  And after ps2 I got a wii and my gf and I play it a lot.  Those wii games that are throwbacks to old style gaming allowed her to learn the patterns and slowly progress to ps3 titles.  \n\nFor example, wii has a firefighter game that's a first person shooter where the enemy is the flames.  Perfect if you wanna get used to navigating in those titles without having to keep track of moving enemies.  Geometry wars on wii allows you to point around your ship and aim - my gf likes the analog sticks better but it is much easier for me to user pointer controls, and I gamed my entire life save several years.\n\nWork your way up.  Mario is accessable to anyone and Wario is too.  Any of their games should introduce you.  Pick some more games you'd like.  Then in a moment of courage try Metroid Prime Trilogy and other first person shooters.  After that RE4.  Then go back to the hd console and try again, keeping in mind analog sticks suck for aiming ;)  They make a mouse for the ps3 that aims and I hear you can use them on xbox, so I'd honestly try that.  To give you an idea of how much easier it is people on ps3 think the fragfx mouse is cheating in Call of Duty.  It's bad enough I refuse to use dual analog and play shooting games with a mouse or on the wii.\n\nFor geometry wars. collect is the key to high scores.  However my gf likes how defend covers behind her - sweep is also excellent at clearing enemies and bait is good at higher levels.  The entire strategy is run from enemies, shoot behind you, and clear paths in front for you to sneak through and loop new enemies in the mob on your trail.  Bomb when this gets insane.  Keep your eyes defocused around your ship and avoid locking on one enemy.  Hope it helps a littlle.\n\nGeometry wars is hard though.  It took me years to learn how to play those 2d shooters well.

It also hinders people from going online with larger non-original hard drives: you either have to have never signed into Live before, or get the EEPROM code from an xbox which has never been online (some people used to sell these for around $10).","c0eeirp":"ha, I lost my gamer tag after not being on xbox live for a bit.  then when i got my 360 I had to enter a new one.

Thank you for making me realise what a shitty company MS is, as they definitely gave 100% on the xbox, and did a good job. Sony can be equal without even trying.","c0ef989":"FUCK YEAH!!! I sold my xbox before finishing Stranger's Wrath,great game!","c0efa43":"Microsoft is very wishy-washy on the PC gaming, at least from my experiences. I really don't see a need for them to push into PC-gaming as it is, as far as a content provider anyway. Microsoft should really be trying to make it a more PC-gamer friendly environment. I know compared to other platforms it is on some levels, but there is money to be made in simply supporting all of these companies that make PC-games, instead of trying to push passed them.\n\nWe've already got distribution services like Steam, which offer their services for free. If you play one of their games you have their service, and they upgrade the content for free. Charging for game upgrades, new content, maps, and subscription fee is most definitely not going to get people to join up on Microsoft's side. What they offer you would have to pay for, while other companies do it for free, it doesn't make any sense. Hell, it barely makes any sense for xbox live. \n\nI can see why Microsoft wants to push into the industry more, but if they do they should be looking to do this as a partnership with other companies, and not  approach it with a \"lone ranger\" attitude, if they go in like that they are going to get their asses kicked by all the names that have been there from the beginning of digital distribution. Steam is a big one, if Microsoft does want to push in like that, they should be looking at Valve, and Steam for a successful model. Charging people to play PC games online that they have already paid for simply wont fly, that is not how PC gaming works, it never has, and unless something drastic changes it never will. They can get away with it with the xbox because there is a solid line drawn between consoles, PC, and the types of services and content they actually provide. \n\n::warning soapbox ahead::\nThe one thing that drives me nuts about gaming with Microsoft is I can't be logged into XBL, and then go play a game of DoWII, it logs me out. I should be able to have my account logged into multiple locations. I can see it not working if I logged into another xbox, but to play online for DoWII I need to activate my live account, I am already paying for the service since I have live, but having to pay to play online content for something that should be offered up for free is downright short-sighted and stupid.","c0efarh":"I agree, it is a clear power-grab. Microsoft doesn't need to push into this market, they simply need to support it to make money. The infrastructure for online distribution, updating, and content management is all there already, and a few of these do a pretty damned good job at it, so there is really no reason for Microsoft to even be pushing into it. I think they developers are also shying away from it because they see it as \"trying to fix something that isn't broken.\" As in, things like Steam are already available and doing well, why not stick with a tried and tested delivery system then go with something new, that in the end is going to cause the end user to pay more money.\n\nGame developers for the PC know that if they can save the game a few bucks a month, the developers may end up getting that money in the future when the gamer buys more games. Microsoft doesn't look at it like this, and the way they've approached xbox live from the very beginning really shows me, and probably most of you that we don't want to see Microsoft push its way into digital distribution, and content. Let the pro's handle this, Microsoft. Just support the developers and give them the tools they need to make windows even more gaming friendly for the future.","c0efqo4":"Tell him it's deal breaker.

I'm fine with my xbox, thanks.","c0embnj":"\"[Crank That](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LpocrqvP2Yg)\" is fun and good to dance to.  \n\"[Turn My Swag On](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0yfNzvNd4PA)\" is powerful, catchy, and very pleasant on the ear.\n\nAside from that, I guess I'll explain yet again to a redditor why I like Soulja Boy.  \nOk, on first glance it's obvious: He's a stupid kid who makes sex jokes and puts them to extremely simple beats that his friends must be pretty proud to have cobbled together on a stolen copy of some music software.  \nBut there's a little more to S. Boy than just supermanning hos.  For one, the kid had, like, 20,000 fans before he even got a record deal, probably before anyone working at a record label had heard of him.  He knows how to work the internet.  In this way he is a shining example of what the so-called \"techno-natives\" are capable of.  Just think of him moving up from clowning around in school, to making his jokes into songs, to making his stupid, jokey, inappropriate songs into a phenomenon.  He achieved world fame this way.  \n\"Crank Dat\" was one of those joke songs, but his other work delves a little further into the lifestyle of the young, nouveau-riche, and famous.  The only other good song on *Souljaboytellem.com* (and I will admit that there's only one *really* good song on each Soulja Boy record), \"[Yahhh!](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UfCmYyG-yg4)\", shows us how committed Soulja Boy is to only caring about himself, his friends, and his career.  His response to everything else in the world is a primal roar.  \nA line from \"Turn My Swag On\" goes, \"Since I was nine years old, I got it in my head, I'm'a die for this gold,\" only to be interrupted by the soundbyte \"Soulja Boy tell 'em!\" (used as background noise in most of his songs).  The rest of the song explains how S. Boy and his friends all wear the best sports jerseys and spend their time lounging around his awesome mansion.  This is the living autobiography of a young goofball turned famous.\n\nI'm gonna guess that you've never read Soulja Boy's twitter.  It is probably the only thing on the whole website worth reading.  The way this boy communicates with his fanbase... well, I think he's the only one who really knows how to use twitter.  One time, and it was only up for a few minutes, he wrote a series of twitter posts, giving an even deeper, rawer look at how he deals with fame.  Luckily (i guess), I was reading the aforementioned twitter at the time and was able to save this text, now lost to the public:\n\n&gt;Shit ain\u2019t how it use to be. Niggaz always fucking up public shit. Niggaz always hating\u2026 this world is looking real ugly right now\u2026\n\n&gt;Yeah I said. fuck all of yall. I\u2019m taking my money and leaving. Gonna go blow kush and live my 2nd dream. this rap shit lame now\n\n&gt;Like why? Like really. My music dream was THE SHIT 2 years ago before I was signed. It was everything I could ever imagine.\n\n&gt;Then I get signed. this is where my dream slowly died.. these crackaz wanna critcize a nigga. take REAL SHIT and turn it to trash\n\n&gt;Water down my music and my appearance and make me look like something i\u2019m not. THESE CRACKERS DONT KNOW WHO THE FUCK I REALLY AM!!!\n\n&gt;I go to the studio make new music for my fans to enjoy and party to. They take my shit hate on me. Make me look ignorant in the media\n\n&gt;It\u2019s all bullshit. Like WHY do I have to put up with this? because it\u2019s my dream? that shit died when crank that went #1\n\n&gt;I know what you thinking. But SOULJA BOY its the American dream your rich I would kill to be in your shoes. thats what you THINK its all BS!\n\n&gt;They say soulja boy u changed. soulja boy u hollywood I ain\u2019t ask for this SHIT!!!!!! I want it to go back to how it was before i was signed\n\n&gt;I might be soundin crazy now.. I don\u2019t really know about alot of things these days. But I just want EveryBODY to know this shit\n\n&gt;Just KNOW that i\u2019m only 18 man\u2026 And it\u2019s only so much I can do. It\u2019s only so much I can take. If your really fans and love and support me\n\n&gt;You would hear me out and help ya boy get thru this shit..\n\nIf you didn't know, Soulja Boy spends almost all of his time on twitter or on live webcam with his fans.  If he's not doing that (or doing a concert), he's on xbox live (and he'll play whomever challenges him in any game).  I guess to tell the whole truth, I don't like the majority of his music.  It's very amateur, and not very pleasant aside from the songs I mentioned here.  He's certainly a stupendous entertainer, though, and a *very* interesting character.\n  \n\n\"I got a question: Why they hatin' on me?\"  \n--DeAndre Way\n\n\n\nedit: wow, I just realized I wrote a whole lot about Soulja Boy just now.  One thing I forgot to mention is that his buddy, Arab, *completely* sucks.  No redeeming qualities.

We'd usually get dinner after. \n\nNext 3 months: Same thing, but now we threw in home-made dinner and blockerbuster rentals. Drops costs to approx $200-400.\n\nLast 6 months: More so on the home-made dinner \/ rental movies stuff. Threw in more \"just chilling at home, browsing reddit together, playing xbox\" stuff. More sex, too. Drops costs to approx $50 (that was the cheapest month) to 700 (that was the most expensive), averaging about 200.\n\nTLDR; Be ready to spend about $500 a month at any given point in your relationship solely on her; anything leftover is yours to spend, anything that's over budget is just part of having a girl.","c0emjj3":"thanks for the real answer.

I think most people who have an iPhone and have used the other platforms, including myself, see the opposite.  The iPhone has what, 85,000 applications?  It can scan barcodes, process credit card numbers, act as an accurate leveler, has full featured art and paint apps (a painting from which made the cover of the New Yorker), works as a remote control for your DVR and stereo, acts as a 32 GB Bluetooth hard drive, more available games than ps3, xbox 360 and wii combined ... the list goes on and on.  I haven't heard of anything Android can do that makes me think \"wow, what I have is really narrow and restricted\".  Quite the opposite.  I don't think the burden of proof is on the iPhone to show that it's fully featured, it's on everything else.\n\nCombine the literally thousands of functions the iPhone has with the apps with it's inarguably superior UI and robust ecosystem, and it's no wonder Apple's competition in this market is taking a daily bloodbath.","c0enocu":"The thing is, I like to have things quick. I go on xbox, invite all my friends to my lobby, and we play our game mode. Quick quick quick. There's no waiting for an empty slot, no choosing, its just fast. I play on consoles with friends. I play on PC competitively. They're two different worlds and I want them to be as separate as possible. The no dedicated server thing bothers me too, but not for consoles.","c0enqui":"As we can see from what happened to the Forza3 console pirates, (game was leaked 2 weeks before release, anyone who had achievements from the game was banned from XBL, and those who could prove they bought the game had their accounts restored - which is pretty much nobody from that crowd) the xbox people are starting to come down hard on pirates whenever they can prove it.

If I had to choose a controller for shooters (besides a mouse and keyboard), it'd definitely be the 360 controller, as the analog sticks are a good distance apart, but for everything else (besides fighting games) i don't have a preference and I'm sure many others feel the same way","c0ensjn":"1.  Yeah, it's definitely fun!  Just find servers that are half-capacity.  You're too much on your own if there are only a few people, and it gets really brutal when full (around 30).  It takes about 20-30 hours to feel like you're no longer a newbie, but it goes by fast.  The reddit servers are really competitive but there are a bunch of PC servers that are newbie-friendly.\n\n2.  Not really a single player mode, unless you find an empty server.  There's not really a point in playing it w\/o other people.  I dunno about the XBox Gold; I've been playing it on the PC.    You don't need a headset for regular play, but it does help if you want to do any leading.\n\n3.  8 vs. 8? is this on xbox?  On the PC, it can be from 1 to 15ish player teams.  The server usually balances the teams, and can be less or more \"fair\" depending on how it's set up.  The servers usually make sure that the teams have the same number of players, but can switch players between teams if one side keeps winning.  You can go out on your own if you do something like scout or pyro or you can team up with a medic.  Some classes require more cooperation than others.  You get to choose which class you want to be on most servers.  Some servers limit the number of each type of class, but they're kinda rare.\n","c0env65":"i don't get the complaints regarding xbox live style matchmaking at all.\npersonally, i think server browsers are a relic of a dead age that i'm glad i left behind most of a decade ago.","c0enyyt":"The PC version has had over 90 updates with many new maps, weapons, achievements, hats, gameplay modes, and general balancing and bug squashing.

It's one thing to offer DLC Oblivion style - you want it, you buy it.  however it's a whole different story when you come to games like Halo 3 and CoD world at war.  Here, these games have ridiculously overpriced maps for sale.  Now, you don't HAVE to buy the map packs - however in halo you can only play a few game modes (out of the ones that shipped with the game) and with world at war you're booted to the menu screen when the server cycles to a map that's a downloadable one.

My 3 year old one runs it well enough to have fun though.\n\nI haven't tried it on the X-Box, but the weekly updates alone are reason enough to get it for the PC.

To those of you who say \"We just like a specific server\", quit bullshitting. Just party up with your friends and play like the rest of us have been doing without complaint for years.\n\nAnd being able to choose which map to play on is also sort of unfair if you think about it. Some guns are better for certain maps. Everyone will almost always pick the gun best suited. That's just pathetic.\n\nResistance 2 has custom map\/mode selection for up to 60 players, however those games are friendly matches and not ranked. Do you know why? Because it's easier to get kills in certain maps, obviously.\nFinally, to those who are complaining about bad connection, the system will pick up a new host if there's a bad connection or if the host leaves as seen in the live demo.

This is how game companies are formed usually from a bunch of friends in or right of college who make a mod or some indie game\/flash games and starting make cash, grow in size and eventually are picked up by a big publisher. Its pretty much like starting off a small business.\n\nOr what you could do is develop a really solid concept with plenty of art and story then advertise this online to get a team of people. It has to be a really strong presentation however with everything fleshed out enough so to convince someone that its worth doing this project. \n\nReleasing on the PC will probably be the easiest and will get the largest demographic.

So the fact that a price drop suddenly makes it a hot product is still *somewhat* astonishing.\n\n I think it's somewhat of an interesting case study. If $100 is all that stands as a barrier for such a product, it says a lot about consumers. A product that fanboyism aside is from a technical standpoint, more inclusive\/expansive and is effectively cheaper over long periods of time. It Also has a significantly smaller failure rate and so forth. \n\nThat says a lot about how consumers think. That it's more profitable to release an inferior, somewhat defective product that forces a lot of proprietary upgrades. I'm factoring the Wii in here too because the evidence supports it too. An inferior product at a cheaper price does garner an overwhelming amount of initial sales. The wii spiked immediately and pretty much went downhill over time.\n\n I'm kind of worried what the next console generation might be like. I think we might be setting ourselves up for a lengthy process of marginal upgrades that don't try to break any barriers. This console war if it has been anything, has been really interesting.\n\nAll that said, I know there are supporting reasons for people to get an Xbox too.

I don't think it would take quite as long for the mid ranged PC to not be able to handle current games as well.

For the money, my $45 gaming mouse and $20 keyboard work a whole lot better. \n\nedit: typo","c0eslxx":"I currently rent out a basement from a family who has 2 kids.  One of them is 6, the other is 2.  It's not what these kids said, but what they do, that shocks me.  One night I was doing homework and the 6 y\/o would not leave me alone, so I had to kick him out.  About 5 min later he knocks on my window in the backyard (basement window) so I get up and go over to the window.  I see him standing in the garden, urinating, as if he's completely oblivious to the fact he just knocked on my window.  Really a wtf moment.\n\nThe 2nd day I lived here after moving in, I was playing xbox (halo 2) with the 6 y\/o.  His brother really wanted to play, so he took the controller from his brother, and gave it right to me.  He then takes it back 10 seconds later, climbs up on my lap and shits his diaper.......\n\nHalf the shit the 6 y\/o says is rediculous.. non stop questions that don't even make sense :|","c0esmhl":"I don't play CoD5 that much so I can't be sure outside of a solution outside buying your friends the other map packs.  \r\n\r\nThat said, someone might be able to help you out more if you post this in \/r\/xbox360.

You can use them on your PC and on most new games it automatically configures the buttons itself . \n\nOn certain games the keyboard + mouse combo is better so if you don't mind switching between the two I'd recommend this.","c0esuei":"The game is great, though it has its small faults. The map system is kind of stupid -- there's no minimap, so going from one place to another (which you do a LOT) means constantly bringing the map up to make sure you're heading in the right direction (yes, there's a compass, but that just gives you the linear direction to go; it ignores obstacles and what not..not that I want my hand held, I'm just sayin'...Diablo 2's mapping system was better).\n\nThe story is kind of transparent, but the characters you come across (or I have so far -- I'm level 18) are pretty hilarious. The humor in this game is fantastic. Though I honestly wouldn't recommend the game to a person planning on playing alone. It just doesn't seem like that would be fun. Maybe for a little while, but having friends to play with, to me, is essential for this game.\n\nAnd the inventory management is a little annoying. Want to use a medkit while fighting? You gotta bring the full-screen menu up and scroll down to a kit -- something impossible to do in a heated battle. But everything else seems okay.\n\nOh, and there are some framerate issues I've seen (playing on xbox), but only when something full-screen-ish happens, like getting covered with acid or blasting a monster at very close range with a shotgun.\n\nHope this helps..","c0esuhp":"&gt;But with that being said, how about we develop a control system that combines the best of both worlds; the single digit operation of a thumb-controlled joystick and a precision point and click device like a mouse?\n\nThat would be awesome.

","c0et6e1":"I like 'em both personally, both have their advantages and disadvantages.\n\n**Consoles pluses**\n\n - Ease of use. Just hook it up to your tv\/stereo, pop in a game, and fun times ahead. No worrying about if you have the latest drivers, no worrying about your specs meet the requirements, etc.\n\n - A single hardware profile. My Xbox 360 from 2005 and someone elses from 2009 are essentially the same hardware; or rather, they perform the same. So developers don't have to worry about supporting some dude's 5 year old video card in addition to some other dude's bitchin' brand-new video card. Additionally, since consoles are dedicated gaming machines, there's A LOT less overhead wasted on running a general-purpose operating system. A good developer can do pretty surprising things with console hardware.\n\n - Depth of catalog. Because consoles are so popular, within a year or two of launch most consoles end up having a fairly massive catalog of games. Granted a lot of it will be iterative crap, but generally there's still a lot of choice, and because things can get so crowded, sometimes very good deals to be had.\n\n - Great action games and a control scheme well suited to them (fps excepted). Consoles for the most part have their roots in arcade games.. some of the biggest console developers (Capcom and Sega for example) are companies whose core strength are arcade games\/arcade-style games. Consoles are really the place to go for great arcade-style gameplay.\n\n - Ease of online play. It's about as plug-n-play as the console gaming experience itself. It doesn't require setting up ventrillo or anything of the sort... just choose multiplayer from the game menu and you're off. In my experience at least, it's far quicker\/easier getting into a match online with a console than it is with PC.\n\n - Cost. This cannot be underscored enough, you can right now get an entire console for the price of a single halfway decent video card. \n\n**PC pluses**\n\n - The potential for superior graphics. I say the potential because in all honesty you need a decent gaming machine to get better visuals than you can from a dedicated gaming console. That said though, if you have the right hardware your visual experience with a PC will absolutely blow console visuals out of the water.\n\n - Greater support for online play. Remember how I mentioned it was easier for console gamers to play online? This is true, but for most PC games (CoDMW2 apparently excepted) you can run your own servers, which means play can continue years after the developer shuts down official servers.\n\n - Modding! Occasionally this is something available in a gimped way for console games, but modding alone is perhaps the greatest\/best advantage of PC gaming. I could write all day on the awesomeness of mod communities alone. There are some 10 year old PC games I play today based on the strength of their mod communities. \n\n - A more varied catalog of games. There may be more games released on consoles month-to-month than there are for PC, but the seeming trade-off is a greater range of game styles, and some truly unique games. \n\n - Deeper games. Civ IV, 'nuff said.\n\n**Console minuses**\n\n - sometimes limited control schemes. Want to play Halo 3 with a keyboard and mouse? I believe the official stance is: \"Fuck off.\"\n\n - sometimes caustic, shitty online communities. Playing Halo 3 on xbox live? The official stance of players is \"Fuck you, fag.\" This varys widely from game to game, but general rule of thumb if it's popular and has violence in quantity, the console online community will suck.\n\n - A single hardware profile. Wait isn't this a plus? Yes it is, but it's also a minus... it becomes more of a minus as they years drag on. Go buy a new PS2 game (they still release them) dust off your PS2 and pop it in... see what I mean?\n\n - lack of depth in the game catalogs for the most part. Want to play a 3rd person adventure game, an fps, or a racing game? We've got you covered... want to play a turn-based strategy title? Well... erm... there is Civilization Revolution. Want to play an economic sim? I am sorry, you're shit outta luck.\n\n**PC minuses**\n\n - Cost. For the price of a halfway decent gaming pc you can have every current console and a few games.\n\n - Shoddy control schemes on multiplatform games. Frequently when games are developed with a console as the primary target platform, the menus\/controls, etc for the PC version are an afterthought at best. This isn't always the case, but it happens far more than it should.\n\n - Drivers, drivers, drivers! Want to play that sweet new game you just got? Well, before the half-hour install... be sure to update all of your drivers! Keeping current with drivers is like a game unto itself... a shitty game.\n\n - Patches. I know patches, even 0-day patches are becoming common on consoles, but still they're weaksauce compared to the scale of PC patches. I recently installed Company of Heroes... and it was something like a 4-5 hours install because of the gigabytes upon gigabytes of goddamn patches it had to download and install before I could even play the game at all!\n\nAnyhow, in a nutshell those are the most salient pluses and minuses in my mind at least.","c0et74l":"If i buy an xbox and post a picture of it on the internet can I be sued by Microsoft?\n\nThe answer is no. \n\nEven if this isn't a scam, you are not claiming to be people magazine, claiming to have made the magazine, reselling the content from the magazine, or posting content from the magazine that you wouldn't be able to see without purchasing the magazine (When you walk into a store they probably have that same front cover displayed next to the register).

Unless there is a wide variety of shows and movies available on Hulu, and not available on Netflix, what is the point of paying monthly for both? How could Hulu compete with Netflix? Netflix is already cornering the on demand market I think, for example being able to stream movies and shows via my xbox.... and on another token, if Hulu makes you pay per view, and you are the type of person who might be inclined to pay per program you watch, then you probably already have I-tunes and do this. So is Hulu going to try and become a second rate Netflix\/I-Tunes competitor that will fail, because it has some corporate TV executives with dollar signs in their eyes, blinding them to reality? But maybe they are thinking intelligently, it seems they are going to keep some free content. So the free content lures you in and somehow gets you to pay to see reruns of crappy network TV. THEY CANCELLED SARAH CONNOR THEY CAN BURN IN HELL.  :D","c0eumr2":"&gt; Latency\n\n&gt; Host Drop Out\n\nI absolutely agree for locally hosted games. This is something you experience regularly in L4D. I wasn't saying that pings will be great and everyone will be happy. I was just noting that given a set of servers, both a person and a mildly competent program could pick the best one to connect to. It's not rocket science.\n\nThat said, while I'm not sure how prevalent they'll be, I believe IW has said that they'll be providing dedicated servers. They just won't be user run. I could be wrong here, but that's just what I recall.\n\n&gt; No community\n\nI disagree here. While we definitely lose the ability to give out IP's to get games going, we gain a new center of access, that being steam or whatever IWnet is. Seeing as how they mentioned full steam support, that gives us access to groups, friends lists and portfolios. Find some kids who you like playing with? Friend them. Get enough friends, make a group (or join one). This goes with clans as well. I'm a member of several steam groups and it makes finding games infinitely easy. I don't have to worry about the server being full and can even chat with people outside the game. This works almost 100% like giving out the ip did, with the added bonus of improved moderation and some extra features.\n\nThe way I see it the focus of the game is shifting to outside of the individual matches, into a space where you don't have to be in a game to be part of the community.\n\n&gt; No Mods, maps, hence no modding community\n\nYea, and this hurts the most, imo. I'm just going to throw out consistent user experience though and leave it that.\n\n&gt; No scrims\/competitive matches\n\nI feel as though steam friends lists have a different set of rules then most others. I have no problem friending someone for a match, then removing them later (granted this is personal, so some may have some issues with this). On the point about irc. If you guys are sitting in an irc channel, you're more than likely part of some community or group - so make a group in steam. Same thing as irc and you can join games directly. As for scrims, it's been a while, but you could just friend whoever you're looking to scrimmage create a private lobby then just have your friends follow you in.\n\nOnce thing I'm not sure of is if you can join games via steam profile, which would make friending people unnecessary.\n\n&gt; Destruction of server ecosystem\n\nThis didn't occur to me, but I definitely see the point. People still use vent, so there's a market for that however I can see that going away as well. I'll have to think on this one, it's interesting.\n\n&gt; VAC is bad - Cheating\n\nI'm not familiar enough with either (or had any bad experiences with cheating first hand), so I'll leave it at that. We have no clue how the matchmaker will work, it might be shitty - it might not. The titanic sucked, so I'm not going anywhere near boats... oh wait.\n\n&gt; No more big games\n\nEven if peoples connections could handle it I don't think we'll even have the ability to do it, it probably won't be an option. That said, and I'm giving IW the benefit of the doubt here, maps were probably built to field a specific number of players, again with the consistent experience. I've heard a lot of tf2 players say they prefer maps with an average amount of people. Maps are built for a set amount of action, if you crowd it too much you lose something. That said, 32-50 player games can get awesomely crazy.\n\n&gt; No competitive gaming\n\nI'll agree that competitive gaming as we know it will change, but I *highly* doubt it will go away. Remember that clans and competitive play still exist on the 360, which hasn't had dedicated servers and it seems to have survived fine. We're also assuming that IW wouldn't collaborate with any existing leagues or competitive sites. On match customization, who's to say we'll need to customize it? Why can't we compete with stock settings and stock number of players per map? Why do we have to disable certain weapons\/perks\/whatever for competative matches. Sure, I'm putting a lot of faith in IW, but by disabling the mod community they've taken on the burden of coming out with a solid game that's balanced and works at a competitive level. There's no solution for spectating yet, but there wasn't for any source games for a while until valve released an update for it. If there's enough demand we may see it.\n\n&gt; Symptom of a larger problem\n\nSo you're saying that the ps3 is a useless platform, since most of the 360 game ports over there are near identical? Each platform has it's pluses and minuses and even if the games were exactly identical (which they seem to be) the PC still offers a lot of value over an xbox. I think the exact opposite is true actually. To save the PC as a gaming platform I believe we need to get closer to the console experience. Developers need to feel more comfortable developing for PC's if we ever want to be a first class gaming system again (and if you think it is, you're absolutely wrong). Developers aren't just going to wake up one day and think, 'Our games sell bajillions on consoles, but I think it's the PC's turn to get our focus'. That's not how these things work. Consoles are easier to developer for, have shown a much larger buying audience and can provide a consistent, solid experience to the end user. To be able to get the same focus consoles do, we have to give some things up. \n\nI did glide over some of your more specific points, but hopefully you get my gist.\n\ntl;dr - a.) We don't actually know how it will perform yet or what else it comes with . b.)

I was periodically annoyed at not having some of the features of Windows (I really missed having visible tabs at the bottom of the screen). But I did get used to it and now I love it.

She knew I'd want them to know I wouldn't be around.\n\nHoly shit the crap I got for that from them was amazing.  \"You had your wife call US first?  gofuckyerselfyoufilthywhoooooore!\" was the first thing my friend yelled at me when I called him after waking up.  He was kidding of course.  A week after I get home I start getting gift cards, money orders, gifts, gag gifts, all kinds of things.  They had started taking up collections from our extended friends list to help me with money problems as I was out of commission at that point.  He knows my wife's cell number so he knows that if I had called him he could call her should I not be able to.  We talk on the dashboard all the time.  We watch netflix movies on the dashboard together, sit, talk shit, laugh and we even cry together about stuff thats happened to us in our lives.  I've known lots of people in my life, and these guys without a doubt know that they are my brothers.  I don't really want to reveal this part but because of love for them and respect for our relationship I will.  I went through a very suicidal part of my life with 2 of them.  I was sucking on the business end of my gun thinking it was over and these guys stayed by my side the entire time.  I have been blessed to make friends like this.  Through it all, thick, thin, hard times and good they've been the most stedfast and loyal friends, no... brothers one could have.  Like any other group of friends we have ups and downs.  But the core, the foundation of brotherhood remains.\n\nMost of them have met since they all live back east and I live in Cali and didn't have the money to fly out.

I wish they would hurry up with it. They already have it set up where you can browse, add and view movies through the xbox. I have use it and it is pretty kick ass. The only draw back with netflix is not being able to watch new tv shows the day after they air. They have a pretty extensive library of movies that you can view instantly and they add and change it up pretty reguarly. Once I can view it on my Iphone I will be content. Also there is already a free app. called phone flicks that allows you to browse and make changes to your netflix movie que via your phone. It works great. Hulu has some catching up to do if they plan on making a play to compete with Netflix imho. ","c0evyel":"Since you already have a PC capable of playing most games then I recommend the PS3. \n\nI wouldn't worry about the xbox failure rate anymore, it seems Microsoft has finally fixed it with the newer models. \n\nI should also warn you that xbox can be annoyingly loud even with the newest models, I haven't played much with the ps3 but I assume it is quieter.\n\nAlso not having to pay for internet service makes the ps3 seem more attractive","c0ew09h":"I'm getting it for PS3. my xbox redringed years ago and although my PC is more than capable of playing it I just don't like the way that games feel on the PC.","c0ew2g4":"http:\/\/xboxlifestyle.net\/2009\/10\/23\/microsoft-xbox-divison-almost-doubles-profits-in-q1\/\n\nprofits beyond profits","c0ew3gu":"I have both systems and I'm a pretty active gamer (4 hours a day) so maybe you're interested in my thoughts.  Here they are in random order:\n\nPS3: \nBlue ray player - I have a 50\" plasma so it's nice to have the PS3 as a blue ray player.  Unlike the PS2, it provides a pretty good movie experience. (It boots right into the movie and the controller is wireless)\n\nPSN - Compared to the xbox, browsing for games sucks.  Also, there seem to be far fewer little arcade games like spolsion man and geometry wars.  The community doesn't have headphones nearly as often because the system doesn't ship with them.  It free but it's not as good.\n\nExclusives - Lately the PS3 exclusives have been better (IMHO).  Previously titles like L4D made me think the 360 had better exclusives.  Now I suspect that each platform will have the lead from time to time.\n\nHardware - I have never been able to tell the difference in graphics. The old 360's RRODed but they've had several versions of improvement since then so I wouldn't let it weigh heavily on your decisions.\n\n\n360:\n\nXbox live: This is a pretty good platform.  Leaving audio messages, finding games, etc.  I'm pretty happy with it.\n\nNetflix: My family is big into movies, probably because we don't want cable tv.  Having unlimited streaming movies from netflix is a big deal to us.  PS3 has been rumored to have something for ages but so far they just don't compete in terms of downloadable movies. They are adding 1080p streaming movies in a week or two if you're not a netflix guy.\n\nController: When a game is offered on both platforms I nearly always get it for the 360 because I prefer the controller.  YMMV\n\nPrice: The PS3 is cheaper after you add xbox live.  If you need a wireless adapter the difference gets wider.  Still, if you want streaming movies or hulu then it's probably worth the extra. If the PS3 does this I'd love some tips on how to get it going.\n\nBottom line: As a gaming platform they are about the same. The 360 costs more but has a better OS and arcade game selection.  The PS3 has a blue ray player.","c0ew3or":"In my house it was the opposite, until uncharted came out.  However, to me that game isn't very replayable so now I'm on to borderlands on the xbox because I prefer the controller.  Still, I'm glad to have both.  They each have their strong points.","c0ew3s7":"It feels like the PS3 gets better exclusives in October but in November when l4d2 comes out things will reverse.  I have both but it's hard to pick a winner for blockbuster exclusives.  When you consider arcade stuff like spolsion man it gets more xbox-centric.","c0ew3us":"BTW, if you get an xbox buy a new one.  I looked at the used market and there were a bunch of 3 year old RROD crap floating around.  Stay new and you'll be ok.","c0ew59d":"The xbox version will only have 500gb and will be so expensive that only the five richest kings of Europe will be able to afford one.","c0ew5fo":"You might want to rethink the hardware issue: [Xbox 360 Failure Rate Reaches 54%](http:\/\/xbox360.ign.com\/articles\/101\/1014486p1.html)","c0ew5mo":"I have a Buffalo Nas and run everything (tv, Movie, music and even books) to my xbox and my comp. \n\nSure, I pay for online. $4.17 a month.

I get what I pay for.\n\nI had a PS3 and I didn't have to pay for anything and I got nothing but headaches for it.\n\nPS3 has horrible loading times and an awful controller. Yeah, Xbox's may be big but who at Sony thought putting the thumbsticks next to each other was comfortable. Maybe if I was 6 I could use that controlled and not develop arthritis.\n\nAlso, why does Sony make their system and online menus so damn ugly? ","c0ew6fd":"You can also do it in OS X as well. I use vuze. It kind of sucks as a torrent client, but to stream to your xbox all you do is drag and drop the file you want to watch to the xbox icon on the app UI. Sometimes, a file won't be the right format to stream on the xbox, and vuze converts it for you.\n\nEdit: I primarily watch TV by torrenting it, and the xbox was perfect for watching it. Also there is netflix which is a feature I use almost every day. If you aren't into that kind of stuff, a PS3 is the way to go. I'm saving up for one right now.","c0ew6xv":"You didn't have to desolder. There were empty spots ready to have new ones soldered in.

I have had 3 surgeries.  The first to save me, and put the colostomy bag on.  The 2nd to remove the bag.  The 3rd to repair a hernia I developed along the stoma line after going back to work WAYYYY too early.  I live now in a great deal of pain.  Seeing as its here in Amerika no doctor wants to give me pain medication 6 months out from surgery.  I moved to California last month to live with my mother for a while and I do get medical MJ when I can afford it.  But the pain is such that work isn't really feasible.  I hate that because I love working.  But I have to do what's right.  I had a ruptured colon.  The dr.'s thought it was from not enough fiber in my diet.  I had several spots of diverticulitis along my colon.  Diverticulitis is a very serious condition in which the wall of your colon becomes weakened in spots, and with enough pressure will rupture, spilling your shit into your abdominal cavity.  So my wife was right when she said I was full of shit all these years. :)  That being said, I'd been having years of problems with my bowels, the runs, constipation, and I would wake up late at night with literally stabbing pains that I would wake up to, then pass out from the pain.  Turns out it was my colon bursting in small spots.  Pushing that hard when going to the bathroom caused an immense amount of internal pressure that just... caught up with me.\n\nSo on to my friends.  Yes, we've done video chats both on xbox and the computer.  We email each other stuff all the time just like IRL friends.  The stuff I've gone through... it was really hard and them going through it with me has been a saving grace.  I think if they had been here in real time it'd be just about the same thing.  I mean we've been together for 7 years on the xbox, running and gunning, shooting the shit, hell sometimes with the old dashboard we'd just sit ON the dashboard in a chat room and talk and play music and eat and yak it up.  A few years ago (way before the 360) we were all going though a really bad spout of MS produced headsets and one night I had gotten the idea to try my plantronics headset from my cell phone.  Well it worked and I went back to the dealer on ebay and bought 12 of them for my friends at the time, got all their addresses and told them I had a surprise for them.  I think that was the beginning of a REALLY deep connection.  They were all blown away that I'd do that.  To me it was just a natural thing to do.  They were cheap, we all needed them and I figured I might as well do it because I really loved talking to them at the end of the day, but we were having so many mic problems it was really frustrating.  After that it seemed that we got even closer.  Since then, one guy bought these jars of hot peppers stuffed with meats &amp; cheeses from a local guy and sent them to us for christmas (we all blame him for my ass problems now!), another sends us cards all the time.  Like I said before, when I was sick they all sent me stuff as a get well present.  It wasn't much, but in there was also Rainbow 6 Vegas 2 when it came out.  They just couldn't fathom playing the game without me, so they all chipped in, called a gamestop down the street from me, paid for it via cc and then had the store call me and tell me to hustle down there, I had something waiting for me there.\n\nI tell you that when grown men cry over the xbox with their friends its a true bonding experience.  We all plan on meeting next year at our friends wedding.  So, can you meet people online and never meet them, yet be the closest of friends?\n\nFriends can come to you from anywhere at any time.

(But I've seen it twice.) During the summer I stayed up at my dad's house in Washington and I didn't have any friends except for a guy who worked for my Dad. He worked in our house so we'd play xbox and stuff. He's 20, I'm 18.\n\nI was learning how to drive at the time and my Dad was too lazy to teach me, so I'd practice with my friend. There were no highways near our house so we'd frequently drive out to his mom's house. (Without going in and seeing her, just taking the curvy roads.) \n\nThe first time I saw the ghost was when it was just getting about to get dark, like right before twilight. The road was lined with big bushes and then pine trees, we were essentially in a forest. (Washington gives this illusion, there were most likely houses 20 feet into the forest on both sides of us.) The spot where I saw him was right after this nasty curve. When I saw the ghost, I knew it was a ghost. It was standing by the road and wearing oldish clothing and overalls. If I had had to guess I would say coal miners clothing? I don't know, that's the impression I got. It was white and appeared see-through and wasn't looking at me or my friend. Even though I knew it was a ghost or spirit or whatever at the time, my friend convinced me later it probably wasn't.\n\nAbout a week later we were taking the same road at around the same time. (Keep in mind we've taken this road maybe 6 or 7 times before.) Right after I turned the curve I was actually positive that something was going to be there, and it was the man again, standing in my lane of the road, facing away. I didn't have time to break, I passed directly through him. We shit bricks. I can't say I remember feeling cold as I passed through him, or whether he literally went through or the middle or the car, or maybe even dissipated but fuck anyone who doesn't believe me.\n\nAnyway, now I'm interested in the paranormal.","c0ewxpy":"I dont like the wii.

I originally started off on the PS3 and had nothing but problems with the connection and the lack of dedicated servers this is manly due to me residing in Australia, I always ended up waiting a long time to actually connect to a game then eventually when I had connected it was to a server in America or Europe and as you can imagine my ping was through the roof and totally unplayable this then resulted in me having to disconnect and start the process all over again. \n\nSo to combat this I then went out and bought an expensive gaming PC just so I could play COD 4 online and select my own servers to guarantee me a good ping and an even playing field, I have been mostly playing on the Internode\/games on net servers and found them to be very reliable and the players to be of a high standard and enjoyed every minute of my gaming on there. \n\n \n\nI have been looking forward to COD 6 MW2 more than you can possibly imagine! \n\nI have watched every video that has been released time and time again I have scoured the internet for as much information as possible and obviously pre ordered the game as soon as I could (my flat mate has as well along with a number of my friends) and this is where the problems begin\u2026\n\n \n\nI found out that you were releasing the Prestige kit with the included night vision goggles so I go running off to EB games with a skip in my step to pre order 2 copies (one for me and one for my flat mate) and when I get there they tell me that IW are not releasing this for the PC and just for the consoles, as you can imagine I was disappointed to say the least but I thought ok I can deal with that as long as I get the game so I pre ordered a normal copy.\n\n \n\nThen I am waiting for 11-10-09 (which obviously should be 10\/11\/09 but don\u2019t get me started on that) with bated breath when  the news hits that PC owners will have to wait a further 2 weeks after that as the release is being pushed back (but only for PC owners)\n\n \n\nThen I find out that the very reason I switched from a PS3 version to a PC is going to be implemented in the PC version i.e. no dedicated servers...\n\n \n\nSo that\u2019s 3 times you have fucked me over on a game I have been looking forward to since I first played COD 4\u2026\n\n \n\nCongratulations IW you have fucked over the very people who first made your game popular and sold out to the console market for a few extra bucks\u2026\n\n \n\nJust to let you know I will go out of my way to ensure that anytime I talk to anyone in person or over the internet about gaming I will slander you as much as possible\u2026\n\n \n\nActually I will now go out of my way to slander you as the one thing I cannot stand is sellouts!\n\n \n\nI know I am in a minority as you will still sell millions of copies to all the little kiddies on their xbox 360\u2019s who love a pick up and play game but you have forgotten about the people who made the game what it is toady\u2026\n\n \n\nAs I said before you probably don\u2019t care and chances are you wont even read this email I just wanted to let my feeling known and if you had any doubt at all I have canceled my pre order as has everyone I know and I will continue to boycott any further release from IW\u2026\n\n \n\nIn closing I hope you all choke on your fucking sellout money and wake up and realize the reason you got into making games in the first place is the opposite of what you have just done!\n\n \n\nFUCK YOU!!!\n","c0f2blo":"The xbox free weekend is coming up this weekend along with the Xbox Live Update October 28 for GTA IV ","c0f2jds":"If you're now facing xbox 360 problems such as \"3 Red Light or Red Ring of Death\", \"E74 Error\", \"Display Freezing\" etc. This website should be your friends.

You need to kick yourself in the ass and get to work.  Get a job.  It doesn't matter what kind of job - ANY JOB.  After you get it, go to work.  Arrive early.  Work hard.  Impress everyone.  You might be flipping burgers, but be the best at it.  This will yeild results.  Your work ethic will be noticed and opportunities will more likely present themselves as a result.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with living with your parents.  Particularly if you have a lot of debt.  The thing is, if you're going to live there, make it count, and don't give your parents any reason to regret that you're there.  Take the garbage out.  Keep your room clean.  Help around the house.  Put gas in the car.  Put some groceries in the fridge occasionally.  Wake up early - even when you don't have to go to work.  Your parents will appreciate your contribution, and will be proud of you for your character.\r\n\r\nYour ex-fiancee is a whore.  You deserve better.  Phone sex is lame.  Getting into a relationship now is probably not going to be a good thing for you - so let this one go for now.  Get to a good place personally before you try to insert someone else in your life.  You'll find that the girls you attract will be of higher quality when you offer them higher quality.  In the meantime focus on getting your money woes worked out - no girl wants a boyfriend that's broke.\r\n\r\nOk - money.  You have to pay back the money you borrowed.  It's that simple.  Stop me if you've heard this one before... don't use your credit cards.  Not exactly rocket science.  Cut them up if you have to.  Keep making payments - even if it's only $5.00 per month on each.  They won't like it, and will probably call you every day - but as long as you keep making regular payments, they really can't do shit to you.  If the phone calls become a bother to you our your parents, inform the collectors on the other end that you will only deal with them by mail.  The law says that they must stop calling you in that case.  Of course the long-term solution is to make a lot of money and pay these off.  See above where I talk about your job.\r\n\r\nThere are all kinds of other aspects to this.  Even if you don't have a job, you need to get up in the morning, shower, shave and get dressed as if you do.  That xbox is not going to help you get a job, so use sparingly.  If you're not working, you should be treating your job search like a job.  Rise early.  Hit the pavement and start shaking hands with people.  It almost doesn't matter who you meet and introduce yourself to... probably somewhat better if they are managers, or work in HR, but there's no such thing as bad networking.  You need to be on your 'A' game while you do this.  Smile.  Strong handshake.  Say thank you.  Posture and body language are important.  If you don't feel confident, fake it.  Look people in the eye.  Go back and follow up with folks that give you any king of reason to think they might be hiring.  Be polite but persistent.  Tell them that you are going to work hard - and that they will never regret taking a chance on you.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of therapy myself... but each to his own.  You definately need someone to talk to though.  Try your parents.  Be honest with them.  Thank them for helping your out when you're struggling a bit.  These people are perhaps your best resources.  They've  been around for a while, and they may have some tips for you.  One of them might have a connection with someone who would be willing to hire you - but they're not going to do it if they see you sitting around hung over at 3:00 pm in your pjs, when you haven't showered for 2 days because you're trying to beat Halo Wars.\r\n\r\nThe best thing you can do is change your perspective on what's going on.  I know that that isn't as easy as I make it sound.  But it really can be done.  Feeling sorry for yourself isn't going to help.  \r\n\r\nIf you can do this stuff, you will be surprised at the results.  I know from experience.... I was 25, unemployed, broke, single, in debt and almost completely without support from family and friends.  I made these changes in my life and it worked.  It wasn't a magic wand - and it wasn't easy.  My only regret is that I didn't do it years earlier.  Now I have a family, a job where I'm valued and well-paid, my wife and I are very involved in our community and we have a bunch of really amazing friends and family who support us.

If you succeed via method a that means you've screwed over the console gamers, they won't get to play the game when its ready for their systems and instead will have to wait until the PC version is finsihed.\n\nThis is a ridiculous statement. The PC version and console version were available and ready at the same time. The delay between PC sale and console sale was not a product of an extra weeks time needed for packaging, as the retailers received both the PC version and console version at the same time. Which is sort of why I pointed out the \"early sale of packaged PC version\" issue to you. Perhaps you missed that?\n\n&gt;Regardless, I get to play it tomorrow after it gets its EU PC release date. That meant I had to wait two weeks after it got released on the consoles in the states! Well, Amigad, you can imagine the tears I cried every night trying to get by without borderlands.\n\nI am very happy for you. There are actual regionalization issues and supply issue between the the EU release and the North American release. Some of them are technical, some of them are ratings related, some of them are simply sales estimates based on the American and Japanese markets related. This delay, to some extent, makes sense, even though it is still pretty shitty.\n\nHowever! When the PS3, XBox 360 and PC versions of the game are shipped to retailers at the same time, and there is a 7 day delay between when the console versions may be sold and the PC version may be sold, it is very hard to argue that the delay makes sense. It's not a development time issue. It's not a packaging issue. It's not a physical inability to sell the game issue. It's not a brief delay to estimate how many to order (trust me, over the last 2 years of Steam, all kinds of statistics on digital distribution versus box sales have been gathered, and the retailers already know these breakdowns). It's an arbitrary delay. We do not really know why 2K decided on a 7 day delay. Perhaps it was a licensing agreement issue with Sony and Microsoft. Perhaps it was an attempt to push console sales. Who knows? All we know is that product was physically available for use on all platforms at the same exact time, but the release was staggered. \n\nThe point you started out trying to make is baseless and does not jive with reality.

I don't really know how much better it would look on a $2,000 gaming PC compared to the $300 PS3.  \r\n\r\n\"console gamers pirate games too, but it's just not as rampant.\"  \r\n\r\nThis is also true, but to a much, much, lower extent than PC.  It's not really because of a lack of understanding of the tech, it's just much more difficult to pirate console games as the manufacturer controls both the hardware and software so they can lock the product down much more effectively.  PC game pirates don't really have to do much other than download the cracked game, unrar, mount the image, install, and maybe copy over a few files.  The process on an xbox involves flashing the system with new firmware (which could brick the system) and in alot of cases soldering new connections on some circuit boards (which could also brick the system).  This is a much more difficult process, not to mention that it voids the warranty.","c0f3kvn":"I think that's only when you bought a new xbox???

It a wasn't a Windows-aversion so much as other factors though that lead me to getting the 360 in the first place. Pretty much, my girlfriend got me a great big high-def tv for my birthday. I wasn't expecting it, or asking for it, yet who couldn't be excited about such a decadent gift, right? So I decided to go ahead an buy something cool for it, a modern gaming system. It wasn't so much an aversion to Windows, so much a preference for being able to play games on my couch with a controller and have friends over and play multiplayer with them. There's also some other benefits like streaming Netflix directly to our TV (which we do constantly).\n\nI realize you can hookup a PC to your TV to game, but really, given the location and uses of my currently desktop it would have involved building a second and expensive computer just for gaming a console won-out. I don't regret the 360 at all. I'm was excited about buying it, but I'm routinely amazed at how much I like it. I enjoy it even so much more than I would have expected. My girlfriend and I have a blast together with it regularly.   And while I do have less control, 90% of the time it's a non issue for me.\n\nHow good Fallout 3 is though, and how deep some of the mods for it are have really pushed me to decide I should install Windows sometime soon and rebuy the game. And good for Bethesda and it's community for making it so great as to do so. \n\nSo thank you, I won't feel bad about installing it and you make an excellent point. My little rant was more a cheeky way highlight how excellent Fallout 3 is to get me to install Windows for the first time in years, rather than a display genuine dislike for Windows.

This is a little bit steeper. Will this prevent people from buying a new house? Maybe a small percentage. Those who are in the market for a new house are in the market for a new house, they will complain, but they will still want the new house.\n\nA $15,000 renovation would cost $300 more in taxes.

No wonder they can't afford to purchase nice cars, nice houses, and do lots of renovations.\n\nNow. If you are just bitching about a corrupt government then I support you. They do give back all of there earnings. They just give them in the form of grants, usually to business, and they usually do not use that money to stimulate the economy.

","c0fdsxc":"cool.  what happens is that the electrical current in electrical wires combined with the resistance of the cable itself (like water flowing through pipes) creates a small magnetic field surrounding the cable.  if enough are intertwined or running along side that magnetic cable can interfere with the cables next to them.  This is usually shown through ghosting.  \n\nSo, you have your xbox, ps3 and computer all run via separate cables directly to the tv, and you switch the source on the TV to change what you want to watch? Is the ghosting only shown through the tv source or ALL sources?  Because if you have an antenna that you use to pick up over-the-air TV, and the ghosting is ONLY on your TV source, I am willing to bet 99.9% that it would be your antenna.  ESPECIALLY if your cable from your antenna is long, coiled up, running along AC\/Extension cords, power conditioners or any 120+ voltage device.   Antennas are VERY prone to ghosting or any image distortion, even if they are digital.  If the signal is analog, there are a million things outside your house that can cause these issues.","c0fdudr":"Solar is really nice. I've put in a few hours on that whilst listening to music.

Now they want to inject ads in to games and such, but my costs still haven't been subsidized. Anyways enough ranting, the point is there is no reason to put up for this for a console whom is imo already in its prime. PS3 has gotten much cheaper, looks much better for games developed for it, and has greater capabilities.

Pick up a gamedev magazine. More money is being made in console games than PC games - and that difference is getting bigger yearly. This is not my opinion. \n\n&gt; While every PC may be different, it is not as challenging as you make it out to be. I don't see this as a console advantage.\n\nWell, whether or not you want to see it as a console advantage it is. *As someone who does it*, developing for PCs is WAY more difficult than for a console. I don't mean a little bit - I mean orders of magnitude harder. Even different driver versions on the same exact graphics card can implement a part of openGL or a shader function differently that can throw all hell into an app. That's just one tiny little thing to worry about - that bites me constantly. I won't go into the thousand other issues that you don't have to worry about when developing for a single console.\n\n&gt; PC gamers do not envy nor want Xbox Live. Next.\n\nNever said they did. Every one of them wants something completely different, and that's what they get...a hodge-podge of non-standardized data &amp; network communication architectures dependent on each game. I didn't mention xbox live to be the ultimate gamer goal - only a reason the console market is more attractive to developers. Is it perfect? No, but once users get on it, they get used to it and the service it provides and it is simple for developers to integrate with it.\n\n&gt; Every game supports every video card, every processor. \n\nNo, they fucking don't. I have bought 2 computer games in the last year that absolutely wouldn't work correctly with my 8800GT. Is it rare? Maybe, I don't know. I have NEVER had a console game just not work. And this goes back to my original comment about why the console market is more attractive to developers: testing for and supporting different hardware is difficult. **Very* difficult. *You* are underestimating just how difficult it is.\n\n&gt; we're arguing what is better in the gaming experience\n\nNo, we aren't. \nYou said:\n\n&gt; PCs have blatant advantages over the console **market**. \n\nBesides, sure you can get great resolution sitting at your computer and you get to use a mouse, but there is more to an experience than just the game.

I don't really know what I'm talking about when it comes to the OSX programming scene to be entirely honest, but if I had to venture a guess: Unreal 3 takes advantage of DirectX (among other windows\/xbox exclusive technologies), which is a Microsoft technology that lives only on Windows and the Xbox 360. Additionally almost all of the development done using Unreal 3 is done for Windows\/Xbox 360\/PS3... I am not certain, but I don't believe Epic themselves have ever shipped a title for Mac.\n\nFor their own purposes\/team and for the industry at large (most developers run PCs almost exclusively, if not entirely exclusively) it makes sense to have well developed windows tool, but would be a waste of developer efforts to program Macintosh equivalents, especially in light of bootcamp.\n\nIf you're seriously interested in getting into AAA game design, you should just get yourself a PC.

Unity3d DOES have an OSX flavor, and while it's not as advanced as Unreal 3, it should be close enough to the deep end of the pool for someone new, but shallow enough you can keep your head above water.

I tried the first boss fight on Hard and got my ass kicked though other fights seem fine.","c0fgeuz":"Really? C'mon, r\/gaming I thought you were better than stupid shit like this.

That. I've been hearing about those a lot, especially the lack of DS. My friends who play on xbox say that no DS isn't such a big deal, and I don't actually understand what it will mean for PC gamers...

Love their PC games and I currently love L4D on the XBOX. Valve is a great company and the DLC for L4D was about half the price you would expect in that situation from another company.","c0fh0vy":"this is temporary. i think it is to get around some contract they have with xbox or something.","c0fh14k":"Yeah, I do the same thing. I also use a program called playon that streams hulu to my xbox 360.","c0fh42z":"If they won't help you out just buy a new laser on ebay for your drive.  They are only like 10 bucks and easy as hell to install.  My girlfriend can install one and she has really no technical skills at all.  Or you could just buy a new drive for around 30 dollars and just switch the boards(cause xbox dvd drives are locked to a console with a key.)  If you have basic computer skills you can just flash your new drive with your old drives key.\n\nThere are plenty of guides online for doing either of these tasks.  So if Microsoft won't help you just take care of it yourself. ","c0fh4c5":"Space Giraffe on xbox live arcade. Costs about \u00a33 and is a brilliant old school arcade shooter.

I repair Xbox 360 RROD with a re-flow machine, and I see even unopened xboxes with the silver sticker that looks tampered.  This is due to the plastics just behind the faceplate that don't quite line up and have a slight height difference.  This causes the tamper seal to appear slightly tampered with.  The new paper seals are just crap altogether... Microsoft is even refusing to repair the 3 year RROD because customers don't have their purchase receipt, even with the date on the back showing less than three years... good luck... ","c0fh4ib":"I have to disagree with the guy who said the xbox 360s community is on par with the PC. I reactivated my xboxlive gold account recently. I played online for about an hour and turned it off because I didn't feel like hearing a pre-pubescent boy yell the word \"faggot\" one more time. What a waste of money that was.

Whenever anyone (usually an american or an englishman) gets cheeky about us being scots it just turns into a battle to regain honour.

That being said, it is nice to be able to play against other people real time and it is far better if you have friends to join you.","c0fhc9c":"You speak of military service like it is shameful, like those signing up today are lesser people.  It is clear you have no clue.  Go back to your dorm room son and play some xbox.","c0fhdg0":"I may be biased, but I loved Bioshock.  It was the first real \"next gen\" console game I ever played when I got my xbox this year.  It was unbelievable to me how far videogames had come since the dreamcast era when I stopped playing a lot of them.  Such an immersive world, with some really fun gameplay (except the stupid hacking), and so far none of the games i've tried on xbox since then have been as good","c0fhduf":"I say yes. Although I don't use it to play online very often, when I want to test my skills, xbox live is far easier than finding good players in real life, and getting them to come over to my place, all at the same time.\n\nPlus, I generally get a full screen to play on, where in-real-life multiplayer requires splitting the screen up.\n\nAlso, if you don't have a life, They run live sessions of 1v100 on friday and saturday nights, for free, for gold subscribers.\n\nI wish it was cheaper, but it doesn't bother me too much to pay for it.","c0fherk":"Dumbest. Thing. Ever.\n\nI will repeat it for you. If a person plays Video games on a PC, they will become smart and successful. If they play the same game on an xbox 360 they will become \"vapid\".\n","c0fhf11":"One of my fondest memories: 12 friends, 4 tvs, 4 xboxs, original Halo. We started at 6 in the afternoon, just after school was over and we had time to set up. We started playing until the host's mother made hamburgers on the outside grill. With full stomachs we played until 4 in the morning, highlights including glitching and pushing the flag carrier across Blood Gulch with a ghost for the game winning point, and getting sabotaged by two members of the other team wielding pillows and airsoft guns. \n\nThese moments, all facilitated by Halo. Rag on it for being overrated and having stale gameplay all you want, but back then, it allowed for some of the most fun you could have with an original Xbox, plain and simple. ","c0fhg1h":"My claims are not bullshit because they are based on past behavior.  I am not claiming something hypothetical, but I am claiming something that I have already done.\n\nI didn't come to you begging to mail you my xbox360.  You are indignant about my claim and demand proof.  You don't understand how fucked up your heart is.","c0fhkhk":"Can you not admit that what you said is stupid? I play games on xbox, and its fun. I am a Molecular Biology and Biochem major. Do you want to know how this is possible? Your dumb claim is false. That's why. I could just as easily say PC gamers are fucknuts for dropping hundreds of dollars on updating their graphic cards. It has its advantages but I spent 200 dollars 4 years ago and have been playing games on it.\n\nI have a feeling that you whole life revolves around video games. Get outside. Throw a [ball](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ball) around.\n\nI understand the downvotes though. I made fun of your PC gaming lifestyle and it hurts. ","c0fhkk4":"I prefer playing on a PC but I love the gamepad. Especially in games I do play on XBox. When a PC game won't let me set up a gamepad like it's an xbox gamepad I get rather frustrated.\n\nThen I just use the mouse and sigh heavily when I press the wrong button. \"No not T. R god damn it! Now I'm dead.","c0fhlo5":"Yes, exactly.  I have an excellent gaming PC and an X-box, and there are some games that are just better on one platform for me.  Modern Warfare sucks for me on the xbox, but is awesome on the PC.  I can't even imagine playing a game like Civilization on a console.  Sports games (football, baseball, others) rock on the console, but suck on the PC.  ","c0fhltt":"This is an area where PC games have actually regressed, since Microsoft took out a whole bunch of gamepad functionality in Vista and Windows 7, and only newer games fully support the xbox gamepad etc on windows. If you want a flawless gamepad experience you need to use XP, which is a big user-friendliness issue which I think was a dick move by Microsoft.","c0fhm5c":"There are 2 kinds of retarded kids. One type has wealthier parents than the other, this dictates whether they get a ps3 or an xbox 360. either way they're a snot nosed and irritating as each other.\n\nHaving said that, overall the ps3 probably has a larger number of 18+ gamers than 360, but if you're playing a blockbuster title like CoD I expect the demographics won't be that different.","c0fhmr1":"Lets list companies that don't allow alternative browsers:\n\nMicrosoft (xbox 360), Sony (ps3), Nintendo (wii), every single phone ever made, pretty much every single web kiosk application ever made.\n\nAre you claiming that every company that's ever shipped a browser except Apple\/osx and Microsoft\/Windows is a monopolist or something?","c0fhnxh":"If it's a PC FPS player playing on a PC against a Console FPS player, there is a good chance the console player is going to get his ass handed to him, however if it's  PC FPS player who's great on PC going to console and playing on the console, he will likely lose..\n\nI find it depends on the game though. I'm entirely comfortable playing Halo on the xbox and can do great at it, but that's because it was a console game at first then later ported to PC. I first played it on the xbox. \n\nNow I'm very strong as a PC FPS gamer, but for games like COD4, etc. I can't play them nearly as well on console as I can on PC. In terms of accuracy at least.","c0fhplw":"You can just plug your xbox or ps3 controller into the usb port and play it that way.","c0fhrdp":"thats a marketing victory, as you've got tons of kids believing that their xbox is a better gaming experience just because microsoft tells them so. it's the same kind of marketing that gets people to pay 60 dollars a year just to use xbox live, which is absolute lunacy. this is how a company can get away with creating artificial value by blocking online play and witholding access to already released downloadable content unless you pay some arbitrary entrance fee that no one else charges. it still amazes me to this day that people so willingly buy xbox live memberships when the PC and the Playstation offer the same features for free. \r\n\r\nLuckily your wife is in a great position as an educator, and should really use that influence to teach kids to do their research on their gaming hardware, not just follow the hype.","c0fhsaa":"That's also my impression but OP says it possible to get a decent gaming PC for the same price as a console. I checked on amazon and the xbox 360 without game is $250.","c0fht4p":"So you're claiming that people don't buy closed hardware such as xbox 360?","c0fhtr5":"Any standard USB headset works just fine with the PS3, in the great tradition of the PS3 working with standard devices, as opposed to making you buy overpriced proprietary shit, the way you have to for the 360. Nothing says bend over, like a [120 GB drive](http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-us\/hardware\/x\/xbox360harddrive120gb\/) for 150 bucks. ","c0fhtsx":"I grew up in a well off family but the computer that I had access to was usually the low end HP model from 4 years ago. So yea, the graphics on my computer were much worse than my xbox and PS2.\n\nNow that I make my own money, I haven't bought a console in forever and my computer is god.","c0fhtzj":"Agh, my self proclaimed \"video game pro\" ex-roommate would insist that he could be much more accurate on his xbox360 controller than with a mouse and keyboard. Seriously... it's just stupidity to think that in my opinion.","c0fhufv":"They pretty much pushed the xbox to it's limits concerning ram with the initial release of tf2. ","c0fhuis":"brand new dvd drive on amazon is around 30$ US  and there are videos on youtube that tell you how to replace it since my xbox is out of warranty they wanted 120$ to fix it, i found the part on amazon  and 3 days later i replaced it with little work so i am much happier with it","c0fhux9":"I'm not taking this as seriously as you think. All I said is that your statement was dumb. You keep on digging yourself deeper and deeper. I play madden and Halo. Does this insinuate that I'm a moron? In fact, I play within a group of morons on xbox live. They go to med\/optometry school. Fucking idiots, eh? There missing out on PC games! The fact of the matter is, if they were playing PC games, they could have been Programmers by now! My little brother checks his email on a PC, I think he's looking into programming now too.\n\nYou can try and turn this around on me and make it seem like your last couple of comments were a \"joke\", but I'm just trying to show you how stupid the last couple of comments you made were.","c0fhv8x":"Doom2's level design was miles ahead of doom1. I recently replayed doom on my xbox and god the levels are bad, wolfenstein bad. ","c0fhvmv":"I will agree that controllers are better for some games, but only if you acknowledge that you can plug a controller into a PC (including your favorite console controllers; xbox, ps2\/3, even wii if that's your thing).","c0fhvng":"Hey its actually a better thing that there are less young pc players. Yes it does suck in a bunch of ways but less immature kids talking trash like on xbox live. ","c0fhwcm":"Ya, terrible graphics.\n\nIgnore the fact that I can run video cards in SLI for cheaper than your xbox 360.  ","c0fhwt4":"In comparison to price, yes the graphics are far worse.  I can get an xbox 360 for $100.  I can't even buy a windows license for that much.","c0fhwvk":"No. It's not possible. Microsoft makes their money off of XBox Live. Customer with no xbox (especially one's that supposedly ends up getting ripped off by Microsoft) = Customer who will boycott there product here on out. \n\nHere's really what happened. \n\n* You spoke with a person who doesn't have the slightest clue about your Xbox or what it does. \n\n* I highly doubt they sent him back the exact xbox he sent them. 10 out of 10 times they send a \" Certified Xbox 360 \" rebuild. Basically a brand new system. Check serial numbers.. bet they don't match. \n\n* Also... You dont get 3 a year warranty with the 360. You get a 1 year FULL warranty with a 3 year warranty for RROD. ","c0fhx8j":"wtf? my video card alone costs more than an xbox or ps3, so it better damn well give me better graphics. Maybe these kids are just too poor to afford anything better than an xbox, so they don't know any better.","c0fhxbt":"my xbox is 3 years and 10 months old, i use it everyday and it still works great, just thought i'd throw in my positive xbox experience :D\n\nseriously though tell them it must have been a mistake during the last repair they should be able to see on record that its been fixed before, they are at fault here","c0fhxp5":"That was so effing amazing to watch that again, and then realize I will have to wait possibly FOREVER ( eh, umm, Duke Nukem Forever ) to get a chance to play that again.\n\nI'd pay 100.00 to buy this game for xbox 360 or PS3. I'm certain of it.","c0fhy5u":"I politely disagree with your sarcasm. Although sometimes updates come to the console, it's nothing compared to installing a high end game for the PC. \n\nThat said, when my 6 year old little girl wants to play Disney Princess on the xbox, she can. No \"logging in\", no arbitrary software running, no alerts, nothing. She pops in the disc and plays. \n\nThey have computer games too (discovery airport is their fav) and it's a pain in the ass to turn on the machine, login, install, type admin pw, deal with incompatibilities, etc. \n\nBoth systems have a place in my house, but the console is easier when the kids just want to play a game. ","c0fhz8e":"Man, I hate that hardware.  Every. Single. Person I know that owns an xbox has had to return it, many of them twice.  \"Hey let's make sure it gets released a year before the other consoles while trying to save enough money as possible, hehe... Oh and put a 3 in the name, because the other console has a 3 and ours will look inferior with a 2 on it...\" Marketing is hilarious.  ","c0fhz8m":"God dammit. can we as redditers please organise a test of this?\n\nHow about an xbox 360 COD4 clan challenge a PC clan to a few rounds of a mutually agreed rules.  The PC people use their keyboards and mice and the XBOX guys use 360 controllers hooked up to PC's.\n\nThe winners are the people who are correct, *but* everyone has to shut the fuck up about it forever.","c0fhzth":"This argument is flawed. What you mean to ask is how much extra you need to upgrade a regular computer to make it equal to an xbox360 only in terms of gaming which is easy to do with $200-$300 and with that the computer would most likely perform better with todays tech. When a person buys a gaming computer, its not like gaming is the ONLY thing they are going to do on it. Computers are better for an endless amount of things and a console is really only good for one thing. They are meant for different purposes and really shouldn't be compared in this way.","c0fi00a":"Not really, it would stop at least some of the bitching about it.\n\nAlmost every 3rd or 4th article on \/r\/gaming goes like this these days:\n\nArticle is about something.\n\nSome discussions about the actual article.\n\nsomebody mention kbm versus controller.\n\nThen somebody mentions xbox rrod.\n\nThen everyone talks about pc vs. console.\n\nRandom talk about 3 year olds on xbox live.\n\nRepeat *ad nauseum* till there is no content about the actual link at all.","c0fi0ti":"There's nothing on ebay like it, but the graphics card and processor you mentioned are going to be \u00a3120 on their own and used, not to mention everything else that is required. An xbox 360 is [literally \u00a360](http:\/\/www.play.com\/Games\/Xbox360\/4-\/719721\/Xbox-360-Core-Console\/Product.html?ptsl=1&amp;ob=Price&amp;fb=0&amp;&amp;_$ja=tsid:11518|cc:|prd:719721|cat:Hardware).","c0fi1rr":"First video I found on Google (tf2 xbox competitive youtube) with some kind if Xbox players. I don't want to bash on console players or anything but seriously, it made me laugh. It's hilarious how NO ONE can hit anything, look, they're just jumping around and the red team did not even manage to block the cap - while they were still all there! Then blue move up to point 2 and meet a heavy. What happens? They just pass each other, like they both know they're not going to be able to hit each other anyway. Instead later on they use melee weapons after failing to hit each other at point blank range... they even use pyros. I have never even seen something this bad on PC pubs. http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Wq2VARZvuIQ\n\nCan't you plug in a mouse and keyboard in the Xbox? If you played on the PC before and know the game you everyone is going to want you on their team.","c0fi33x":"Thats why im pretty sure he said, If you dont get them pre-built. \n\nIf people only knew how easy it was to troubleshoot hardware on a computer, they would scoff at the other 'consoles' and their lack of upgrade capability. \n\nWhats next ps4 the wii v2.0 and the xbox 1080 ?","c0fi3p4":"Thanks to xfire, I can tell! \nhttp:\/\/www.xfire.com\/profile\/caneut\/\nThis does not include the starcraft I played before 06, which was a lot. Plus all xbox I play on Halo, Rock Band, and MW2 coming out in 2 days.","c0fi4og":"Console games cost 20$ more than pc games. So assume you buy 5 games a year, that's 100$. Add another 50$ for live. 150$ per year. Let's assume a 4year cycle, that's 600$. Add 250$ for the console, 850$ total.\r\n\r\nCompare it with this 600$ pc\r\n\r\ncase+550w = 60$\r\n\r\ncpu : athlon ii x4 620(2.6ghz) = 100$\r\n\r\nram : 2x2gB ddr3 1333mhz = 80$\r\n\r\nmobo : 790gx = 80$\r\n\r\ngpu : 5750 1gB = 145$\r\n\r\nhd : 250gB = 40$\r\n\r\ndvdrw : optriac = 20$\r\n\r\nkeyboard+mouse = 15$\r\n\r\nos = windows 7 home premium = 80$\r\n\r\nThis pc is vastly superior to xbox 360. Quad core cpu and a kickass dx11 gpu. And i didnt even bother keeping any parts from your current pc(like case, psu, hd, dvdrw, keyboard+mouse, windows) which could lower the cost even more(-200$).\r\n\r\nWith this pc you can do a lot more than just playing. And dont give me the bs about \"you need to upgrade your pc every year in order to play games\". No, you dont. First of all, pc games can scale down. Even if there is a crysis 2 tomorrow that wont run smoothly at 1920x1200 res, you can scale down the res at 1280x768 or lower some effects and play it just fine.\r\n\r\nNot to mention that 99% of the games are multiplatform these days and i dont think that we will see a new xbox or ps anytime soon. So since games will have to run on current gen consoles, they will most certainly run on this pc(with far superior graphics). And not to mention, that on the pc, you actually PLAY the games, you arent mildly participating in a semi-interactive film(by using autoaim, huge aiming circles, etc).\r\n\r\nSo if you want to play(not mildly participating) games with better graphics and cheaper, get a pc. Not to mention that for 2 main game genres, rts and fps, pc is the only way. If you know how to build a pc(choose the right components), you can make a gaming pc that will play games for a long time while being pretty cheap.\r\n\r\nFor example, a p4@2.4ghz with a 9700pro. I was using this pc for gaming for 5+ years. A c2d 6600 and a 8800gts 320gB, again a solid pc gaming rig for 5+ years. Also note that 99% of console games run at 720p, which is 1280x720 res. This is ridiculously low for a pc resolution. Most gamers play games at 1680x1050 res, which is TWICE as large as 720p. And despite running games at twice as large res, they get better effects and higher fps.\r\n\r\nAnd dont give me the crap about \"but i want to play in my living room, on my 100\" tv, not on some tiny tv\". All modern video cards can be connected to your tv and you can play from your sofa. You can even use wireless xbox 360 controllers(but then you lose 1 of the big advantages of pc gaming, the mouse).\r\n\r\nPS And i didnt even bother mentioning mods or private servers with low ping. Consoltards are happy to use the official servers with 200ms+ pings, because ping is irrelevant with semi-participating in a mildly interactive movie(console game).","c0fi50m":"Mute the other players.

Some people have trained themselves to use a controller quite well.  I think the learning curve is higher for a controller especially when you are used to other control inputs.  I know for sure i still can't play any fps with a controller to any level but I can hold my own on the pc.  What's funny is on the original xbox I picked up some FPS games and semi-FPS games and basically couldn't make it past the first level using a controller.  A good example was kill.switch you had to rapidly aim from multi-levels and areas on the screen fast.  I tried for weeks and never got past the first level.  I picked up one of those add-ins that transforms a controller into a mouse keyboard controller.

Games are less about story, characters, and gameplay, and much more about advertising and working on the sequel. The day I saw in game ads for Axe all over my Splinter Cell and Rainbow Six, I saw it clearly happening. Instead of being developed for one or two platforms, they now have to be developed for 4 or 5. Graphics are the main focus, not gameplay. Final releases are really extended betas with purchasers being the final beta testers. I'm sorry, but there is no fucking excuse for a game to need to be patched or updated on xbox live within a few days\/weeks\/months of release. That is poor quality control.\n\nI'm no fucking hipster, this is just how it is. Better graphics don't always equate to better games. They should only make really good games, *that much better.*","c0flmev":"Oh man I loved dead space. Have not played it for months.

That alone is almost worth the subscription cost (despite the increased amount of 12 year olds calling me the 'n' word every 10 seconds). I find the microsoft interface to be \nmore intuitive as well. When I had an xbox I had a bunch of online friends that I met in-game and would frequently play with. With my PS3 for some reason I only play with my real life friends (the few who own a PS3.)  Which brings me to what is probably the biggest plus of XBL, it has a massive user base.  I'm always feeling left out as a PS3 owner because it seems that the XBOX is the go-to console for all multi-platform games.\n\nI'm not trying to present this as 'why xbox is better for online play' but rather as 'why I prefer xbox for online play'.","c0flsok":"I think I might have accidentally clicked \"report\" instead of \"reply\" to your reply, so if something comes up saying I reported you, please accept an upvote as an apology.

Anyway, Roy was amazing, as you can well imagine and I'll never forget being there.  ","c0fmat9":"Oh man. I knew I'd break out into a tl;dr here... **Here are my observations after years of going to bars and clubs.**\n\n**There are pretty much almost no good lines.** It's like 40% delivery, 20% content, and 40% \"does she already like you for some reason.\" The HARDEST thing is just breaking the ice *somehow*. You could be right next to someone and until you talk to them they might as well be 1000 miles away. I'm sure you know the feeling.\n\nMy general strategy is to find a \"[plausibly deniable](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Plausible_deniability)\" excuse to chat someone up so I'm constantly on the lookout for those types of opportunities.\n\nI have had embarrassingly good success with these after just a handful of drinks:\n\n(said to a pretty woman that I was strategically standing behind, at a crowded bar with a male bartender) \"Mind showing a little leg so the bartender would actually take our order?\" (She was responsive, but unfortunately, engaged. I still suck at checking for that. But she liked me enough to introduce me to all her female friends. Sadly she was the prettiest\/most bubbly one.)\n\n\"You're the prettiest person in this bar\/at this party so I figured I'd go for broke.\"\n\nThen you can do stuff like offer to take people's pictures. Be on the lookout for cameras. Once that's done, the ice is broken, segue into something else.\n\n**Bridal parties** always need random dudes to pull various stunts. This is yet another icebreaker. Watch for the girl with the cheap crown. Ask her group if they need a victim. Segue into something else.\n\nMy buddy had a pretty foolproof system that consisted of bringing a bag of blow pops and offering **candy**. Who doesn't like candy? Bam, there's your icebreaker.\n\nSpeaking of buddies, I've had far more success meeting people when *alone* or with 1 other person than with a group of people. It's just way harder to break out of (or into for that matter) a group. Don't be afraid to be alone (this is sort of my specialty, but I know it's not for everyone).\n\nBars with narrow corridors to walk through or past are best. I think they have good **feng shui**. If you have to get past people, that's more opportunity to chat anyone up about anything.\n\n**Bar real estate basics**: If you get the corner of the bar, keep it! Tons of people will have to get next to you to get a drink. Don't be That Guy\u2122 vulturing near the bathrooms, though. That's bush league. ;)\n\nIn 10+ years of going to clubs (I kinda like techno), I've been able to take a girl home all of 3 times or so. From this I learned one important lesson, other than that I hardly have any game :) . A lot of what I have to offer is talk\/personality. If loud music is playing that I have to scream over, **I am losing**, as an educated person. I am losing to the bodybuilder guy who knows how to dance something other than \"white-guy\". On the bright side, women *definitely* go for decent talk\/personality\/humor... including the pretty ones. While we are mostly idiots fascinated by tits and ass. =\/\n\n**Eye contact**: Twice or more is a good bet. More than 1 second at a time is a good bet. Some women will actually be insulted if you don't take advantage of these types of signals. The eye thing took me a long time to figure out too for some reason. Some guys have these gifts naturally, others not so much I guess, and have to learn them through careful observation and introspection. I STILL have to remind myself when I go out not to immediately lower my gaze when it is met by an attractive woman (I was seriously geeky as a kid). You're the man, you have a lot to offer, feel confident.\n\n**Mood**: If you don't feel chipper, don't bother going out. It won't go that well. The corollary is that if on some random night, even a weeknight, you DO feel pretty bumpin', take advantage of that and go out and show that shit off. People notice that.\n\n**If a woman ever offers you sex** (scenario: hot redhead at party, tons of making out followed by her \"I want to feel you inside me\") and you have to decline for any reason (like, me stupidly wanting to date her instead of just fuck her because I just met her and didn't want to fuck it up), know that you will **never see that woman ever ever again**. Super bad insult to her. Took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that. Instead I was really hurt =\/ My reasoning was something like \"I offer sex to women all the time and they can't and it's no big deal!\" Silly nerd, chicks are not like us :)\n\n**Body language**. Facing you = good. Facing at an angle to you or looking around = not so good. I had a gorgeous half-black woman grabbing my hand somewhat sensuously at a bar... Congratulations, this means \"get the check and show her your awesome 300 movie poster in your bedroom\". ;)\n\nSpeaking of which, \"normal\" seduction touch order (while chatting her up\/making her laugh): Shoulder, elbow, lower back, hip (latter 2 when guiding her through something, they seem to like that a lot), knee\/outside thigh, hands, I think is the rough order. After that you can probably kiss her right at the bar. And then get a room cause you're making me uncomfortable. ;)\n\nI am 100% certain that there are THOUSANDS of opportunities that I missed because I am daft, it went over my head, I was clueless, I was too drunk (...see below), etc. Don't worry, some percentage of the time you *will* get it and something fun may happen.\n\nIf you get a girl's number before the end of the evening and then continue to hang out at the same venue, chatting people up that are best described as \"not her\", you insulted her because you weren't truly interested, you just wanted to scorekeep (I am guilty of this, women seemingly ignored me till I was 21, so the novelty of finding out I could actually get womens' numbers took me a while to get bored of). Change your venue. NOTE: Facebook-friending her on your iphone is possibly the only exception to this, but maybe because it also carries a lot less weight.\n\nI can only deal with a few rejections a night. Like I said, I'm no jock, and I get sore. Go to an area with a few bars so you can hop if you must. If you hit your limit (you'll know), time to swish down a couple more drinks, then take the dudes home and play some ps3\/xbox. Shit happens, you sleep on it, the next day it's all better again.\n\nOne last note: **Leveraging alcohol**, or as we called it in the military, \"liquid courage.\" The most optimal effect happens after only a handful of drinks. Once you start getting pretty drunk, all bets are off (unless the women are as drunk, in which case \"random making-out\" happens, but usually it means you lose game). I have had some pretty funny stories when very drunk, however. Note that about an hour or 2 after you stop drinking you will most acutely feel the depressant effect.\n\n**Post-drinking self-care**: Before you crash, if at all possible, **drink a giant glass of water with a multivitamin**. Then refill it and park it next to your bed. This should take care of any dehydration\/potassium depletion (major cause of hangovers). For the potassium you can optionally also eat a banana or drink a tall glass of OJ.","c0fmcvr":"It's a bad product because it's a port with very little tweaking for the PC.

Full of pirate ships.","c0fnc0j":"I am thinking I should have bought the xbox version....\n","c0fnc2y":"Live hasn't really degraded so much as it's population has increased with it becoming more mainstream. Back on the original xbox with games like halo 2, a lot less people used the service and as such the people that you would typically encounter were usually more serious about the whole gaming experience. This is not to say that there were no trolls, douche bags, or young children back then, just that you saw less people falling into those three classifications because less people used the service and those who did use the service were more dedicated to having a good gaming experience. Now days the population is absolutely massive and we see a large bulk of it being made up of kids that get Mom and Dad to buy them what ever game they want, regardless of how appropriate it is for them to be playing, and the online service without setting ground rules. Because Mom and Dad are the ones paying and do not monitor what happens on the service, junior doesn't understand that others are paying for an entertaining, enjoyable service, and as such they really don't care if others are having fun as long as they are enjoying themselves; a bunch of spoiled, unsupervised kids with an undeserved sense of entitlement are the trolls and douche-nozzles that ruin the gaming experience for everyone.\n\nHaving gotten my rant out of the way, Halo 2 is very different from Borderlands and L4D in terms of online experience; the problem arises from the fact that xbox live was built around competitive games like halo and as such the entire gaming culture of xbox live is built around the \"competitive dick\" mind set. In halo, people were in all honesty always dicks to some extent, in the sense of childish name calling and most importantly, taking the game seriously to the point where almost every player thought that they were professionals and far superior to everyone else (the competitive dicks). In games like Borderlands and Left 4 dead, for the online to work, players need to work cooperatively; though in the case of L4D, a competitive mind set works to some extent. Because the \"competitive dick\" mind set is so commonly accepted by the Live community, most people don't understand how to appropriately behave in games like Borderlands where the lack of loot system and huge focus on teamwork demands cooperation and trust, or L4D where communication with teammates is more than just a way to belittle another. This is why, when combined with the lack of connection between players created by random matching, the mind set of xbox live makes cooperative games less enjoyable.","c0fnc9t":"For the first two weeks that L4D came out it was probably the funnest gaming experience I'd had in years.  Everyone wanted to work as a team, advance through the levels together at a decent pace, heal each other when they needed it, etc.  Recently though, it's just been total shit.  Everyone knows every level inside and out (as that DLC we were promised turned into a full priced game of it's own, everyone's been playing the same few maps over and over) so every game turns into \"race as fast as you fucking can to the end don't stop for any weapons or to heal\".  God forbid you actually shoot some zombies, a simple karate chop is all that's required as you speed past them.  Versus is even more of a shit show; between the rage-quitting and people refusing to play survivors it's just an exercise in frustration.  It makes me wish I had bought it on xbox as opposed to PC, at least I could have sold it after the first couple weeks.","c0fncdd":"It's not just that. I hacked my xbox 1.0 so it could work on the home network and play videos via wireless. I may have copied the _occasional_ game, but I bought 80%-90%.\n\nIf MS had banned me, I would have stopped buying games completely out of anger.

They should be campaigning with us for a better console experience rather than critercising PC gamers for expecting a higher standard from the products we receive. Console gaming is eveolving its not just casual gaming anymore and the content creators need to look at that and cater for the emerging market like they did 15 years ago for PC gamers. Instead they gimp our product because they feel they can get away with marketing a lower quality game to people who are in the future going to wake up and want more community and a more highly competitive environment to play in.\n\nTo me the xbox 360 and Microsoft are the perfect product and team to take dedicated servers and mods into the console arena. They have the basic infrastructure set-up already with there ability to update the firmware of the 360 and add downloadable content to games they just need to tackle this and innovate to get competitive console gaming taken more seriously and up the bar on what content producers are expected to give the whole of the gaming world.","c0fncxl":"Couldn't you just format the drive, or at least delete the profile from the drive and get a new xbox? then, just recover the gamertag on the new xbox.

RPK rapes through walls, the AK can do the same thing but it doesn't have the clip size to sustain fire. I would take the AK74 over the P90 any day, but it still doesn't change the fact that the P90 is perfect for running and gunning at close\/medium range. You don't need to reload nearly as much.

Steal?","c0fp27t":"Not that I know of.  The best thing I can think of is have a burned game with you when you go to buy the console. If it plays then the xbox is modded and most likely banned (if the asking price is cheap).  The article says prices are as low as $90 for banned consoles, but I bet you can get one for half that.","c0fp2z7":"Thats ok, after finishing the story mode for MW2 on the xbox version, I would be just fine reading plot synopsis for MW3 on Wikipedia just to know how the story ends.\n\nAs for multiplayer, I'll stick with COD4","c0fp3ol":"There are no other downsides, I own a xbox360 and I've never played online (you have to pay !). The only reason i bought it in the first place was because i could modify the firmware and try several games. Also it's good to play offline with friends, games like PES and StreetFighter\n\nThe only games which I find amusing playing online are RTS and FPS, and those cannot be properly played on a console.","c0fp4ke":"I always wondered what PSN would be like once the userbase increased.  To be honest I always thought the xbox problem was over embellished, I've been using it for 3 years and not had very many issues with 13 year olds giving abuse and I play COD4 and Halo a lot.\n\nIs it that bad?  Is there no way to report bad behaviour?","c0fp4lw":"Yes, it is.  Do the math, it's much cheaper to buy a new console every ban wave and mod the console than it is to just pay for the games.  That, of course, depends on how many games you pirate and whether you buy the top of the line console or just a regular one.\n\nWhat has happened now, and why this is such a big deal, is not that MS has banned pirates.  They do this every year.  Why this is a big deal is that MS has a new liteon drive that people haven't figured out how to dump the key from yet, so you basically have a situation where a million pirates get banned and then have no possibility of getting a new console to pirate with and play on live.\n\nAnyways, I know a lot of people with multiple xboxes, one for live and one that has been banned that they play offline with.  You can also pirate arcade games and dlc if you want.\n\nI'm not saying to go out there and pirate software, I'm just saying that it does save a lot of money.","c0fp4nn":"I've got a serious case of the reality-is-fucking-boring-itis.

If I spend $60 on a game and 2 years later I am still playing it, then it is obviously a pretty good game.  Most of these numbers for halo are NOT new sales.  The game is over 2 years old.\n\nAnd the marketing thing is true, for a short period of time.  I remember I first bought my xbox and I got a couple of the hyped games, I played them for a week and traded them into game stop because they sucked.  The same happens for all games, if the game isn't worth playing people don't play it.  Yet, 600,000 people a day play Halo 3 ONLINE over 2 years after it was released.  That is a pretty huge amount of people for a game that is 2 plus years old.","c0fp6t3":"legitimate options = buying a 120gb HD for $100.

Still, the profit is probably too small to be the primary goal.\n\n&gt;Unless they're planning on offering a 'fix' for a reasonable price to owners of modded consoles I don't see how this benefits them. They can't artificially inflate the number of users on Xbox live.\n\nThat's a good point, but it could still lead to some headlines. Constructing scenarios which lead to misleadingly favorable headlines is one of Microsoft's favorite tricks, so I wouldn't be surprised if that went into the equation.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that they do still benefit from an expanded user base, even if it doesn't come with a corresponding increase in XBL users.","c0fpqr2":"Also to add you can download the main updates from xbox.com and do them manually with a disk.\n\nAlthough i am not sure why your getting downvoted.

The xbox tends to use FSAA, due to the way the GPU can do it at virtually no computation expense, which offers better image quality. So yes, it does actually decrease the overall image quality.

However if the developer takes time when making the port there don't seem to be issues.\n\n* Games made specifically for ps3 tend to look better than xbox games\n\n* Players on Xbox live talk more, A lot of ps3 players don't even have headsets, although this is slowly getting better\n\n* Both PS3 and Xbox have netflixs compatibility \n\n* My opinion: ps3 controller better for fighters, sidescrollers.  xbox controller better for fps games, racing\n\n* PS3 has more reliable hardware and built in wi-fi. Although you with probably want to use an ethernet cable anyways. \n\n* PS3 it is easy to replace the ps3 harddrive with a much larger one.\n\n* PS3 up scales dvds, plays avis\n\n* Xbox live is more robust and has better chat capabilities\n\nBut what it really comes down is the online play.  Do you like playing games when all the players are talking to each other? Or do you not like hearing other players?  If you have friends on either system then this is not as big of an issue.

I don't play competitively, I play casually but I still expect a good level of gameplay and a P2P system just can't provide that.\n\nThe biggest problem (not the biggest for me personally, but the biggest for everyone) is hacks. If I join a server in CoD1 (Yeah, I still play it!) and I have an aimbot I'll be banned by an admin if it isn't caught by Punkbuster, if I join a Counter strike source server the same will happen, it's the same for every game with servers but MW2?

Also VAC has delayed bans, so I could join today with known hacks and play weeks without being banned, how is that fair to players?\n\nNot to mention the lack of custom maps, game modes, game modifications.

While the XBL community is barely better than the 4chan community (only because they're too stupid to stalk you), I do enjoy the simplicity of turning it on and getting into an online game quickly. Seems like often with PC based games it can be a hassle to find a decent server and cheating is seemingly always rampant.

And offered on PC with more polish? I'm sorry, have you ever heard of a game called Modern Warfare 2.\n\nOf course the graphics on it are going to be dated compared to brand fucking new hardware. Did you have a team of monkeys working on that round the clock for you? You want to compare a brand new gaming system to a fucking console? There's no comparison.

The 360 hasn't proved that at all since it is only doing ok compared to the ps3, and only then if you consider \"better than the xbox did vs the ps2\" as \"doing well\".  It has not been \"extremely successful\" by any means.  Also, the 360 has virtually no good games, only a glut of casual shovelware that is suffeciently brown and macho to trick frat boys into thinking they are playing real games.  \"It sold ok\" is not the same as \"it has lots of great games\".","c0fr4xt":"Alot of n00bs are jumping on xbox live, you can tell that they aren't used to \"talking trash\" through a microphone.

When you find a good server that you fit into the game becomes so much more fun. On good servers the admins will kick out the racists, cheaters, griefers, and other undesirables that xbox live and other closed services are known for. You'll get to know the admins and other players, make a few friends even. Plus most server communities run websites with forums and extensive stats plus most hold votes on server changes and such. The really good ones will hold regular drawings and contests. I play on StompFest servers and they give away things like G9 Mice and Fatal1ty Headsets as monthly prizes for random drawings and top ranked players.\n\n You'll also find it can really help improve your skill because most of those communities are made up of skilled dedicated players who are also willing help if your new. Also many communities will form competitive teams that participate in various leagues. I've found this to be the case in FPS, RTS, RPG and racing games.

I'm really a fanboy of neither, and have owned both. The argument is absurd because *in the end* one is just as good as the other, and they're both better than their counterparts in some areas. PC gaming will always be geared towards hobbyists and consoles will always be geared toward the masses. PC gaming will always be better than console because of that huge generation gap. At the same time I think consoles gaming will still \"outsell\" PC gaming because the console is home entertainment component. The masses don't realize things like these *have* generation gaps or see the difference in a $500 computer and a $1000 dollar computer. They definitely don't yet realize it's the sum of the parts inside. To be honest, I was a console gamer before I was really a PC gamer (hate to have to use labels like that). I would play plenty of PC games - I don't even want to know how much time I spent playing Diablo 2. But at that time I had an xbox, friends had xboxes, and maybe a couple people had nice computers. But I gave up on trying to play PC games because my computer couldn't cut it, I didn't have the money for upgrades, I wasn't a hobbyist at the time and an xbox and ps2 were *good enough*..I really don't think that today, $1500 is an expensive estimate for a high end setup from the ground up - starting with zero parts. I'm sure a couple hundred could be saved somewhere, but after taxes and misc crap, $1500 isn't too far off.\n\n&gt;I just don't want to be tied down to a 7-year hardware release cycle, so I don't bother.\n\nNor do I but some people just don't care, or think about that sort of thing.

They've leveled the playing field on system price and since getting one, I've noticed a few key things:\n\n- online is free ($60\/year on live)\n- you can bring your own accessories:\n  - most laptop HDDs work in the PS3 if yours goes bad or you want to upgrade\n  - any bluetooth headset works fine\n  - any usb storage device works for backuping up\/transporting game saves and general system data\n\nMS makes a killing on branded accessories and does not allow for unlicensed ones.  I hate this practice.  It may not be applicable to you.  I think you get a free headset with most xbox packages.\n\nxbox live has the qualitative edge over PSN, but if you are truly on a budget, you cannot argue with free.  I've been playing borderlands and modern warfare 2 on PSN and its not bad besides a few launch hiccups.  There definitely are fewer people playing on PSN.\n\nThere are many cases where there is possibly a slight edge to the xbox on the multiplatform titles, but I really doubt that you are going to notice a difference.\n\nIf you want to get online to play, consider borderlands and Modern Warfare 2.  They are on both platforms.  If you go PS3, I recommend adding uncharted on the cheap.  Of course, if your friends have xboxes, its a no brainer.  They'll likely loan you their old games.\n\nEDIT:  I didn't mention fallout 3 (both consoles) which is my favorite game of the year and will also kill a lot of time.

Producing Bibles costs money, and one way or another, they're getting bought.\n\n&gt; Also don't forget that because they're a church it's tax free.\n\nThey're not a church, they're a publishing company, so I'd bet that they pay taxes on any profit they make.  Making products for Christians doesn't automatically exempt you from taxation.\n\nAs for the numbers, MS has only sold [10 million XBox 360s](http:\/\/www.t3.com\/news\/microsoft-hits-10-million-xbox-360-sales-mark?=42223) to date, so at the most we're talking about an available consumer pool of about 720,000.  Even so, given that we're talking about a platform that people bought *for* gaming, it's unlikely that a Bible app will beat the game that currently holds the record for most sales on XBox Live, which had only sold [200,000 copies](http:\/\/kotaku.com\/5349557\/shadow-complex-sets-xbox-live-sales-record) as of April -- particularly since pretty much everyone in their likely consumer pool is likely to already own a Bible in some other format.\n\nI'd like to see how much of the cost of any purchasable XBox Live app actually goes to Microsoft.  I suspect that it's a fair amount.  Either way, I doubt we're talking about even a million dollars, likely all taxable, going to the publisher.

You cannot at all connect to xbox live, any attempt comes with a message \"This console has been banned from xbox live due to forbidden restrictions, there is no recourse for this\".\n\nSo it's a modded xbox 360 that's really only good for pirated games that have a decent campaign mode.  Batman Arkham Asylum, Fable 2, Prototype, NHL 09, FIFA 10, Saint's Row 2, GTA: IV, and some day - FFXIII.  ","c0frfzj":"I think \"ripping you off\" is a bit extreme. I think we'd need more details to go on anyway. Did he ensure you that it was not going to be banned when you purchased it, and if it was he would refund your money, or did he say if it ever gets banned at any point in the future he would refund your money? Because honestly.... a ban is almost an eventuality when you have a modded 360, so if he really did offer a refund if the Xbox ever got banned, that was horribly stupid of him.\n\nI don't understand why he'd agree to the swap for the xbox + $80 and the ps3 either. To be honest both of you sound pretty shady (don't deny it, you're complaining about a console you bought second-hand to pirate games for, and I know you said you don't care about the fact that it's modded... but c'mon, really? You're fooling no-one. Buying something that risks a ban to do what a non-modded console can do is just nonsense, I don't buy it for a second.) and sometimes this is how things go between shady people. If I were you I'd chalk it up to the cost of doing shady things and still enjoy the modded xbox... just obviously not on xbox live. That shouldn't stop you from pirating games however, if anything it frees you up from the issue of needing to stealth things and\/or wait for release day before playing.","c0frg5w":"I was banned today.

","c0frjv6":"Well for one, using your argument that I should pay for a game in order to play online, why the hell do I pay for Xbox Live in the first place on top of the purchasing of a game, unlike PS3's and Wii's, which have nearly the same quality of online gaming.\n\nGranted, Microsoft says their next-gen will probably have free XBL.  \n\nThey may have the ability to brick my console, but I think that would be pushing it legally.  It is indeed my property, it is not a rental with a contract.  It's true, after making illegal modifications that are most likely used to pirating games, they don't have to provide me with the service of xbox live but to completely disable a chunk of hardware that I own is wait out of line.  \n\nAs well, there are certain DMCA laws that say you're not allowed to make digital copies of your own DVD's and companies try to use this as an excuse to ban any software that has the ability to rip DVD's and CD's when it is a legitimate argument that people who purchase legal copies of DVD's and CD's want to create backups just in case something happens to the original.  Using this same argument, one should be able to make backups of videogames they legally purchased in case something happens to the disc.  You're allowed to save games onto your 360 hard drive but you can't use that hard drive version for online play, so if you lose the disc you're fucked and have to spend another $60.  Unless, of course, you mod your xbox for the purposes of your own backups created from legally obtained originals, which for some, it really is the only reason they mod their xboxs and they don't download illegal copies at all.  \n\nYes, I was downloading illegal copies of videogames, and if the theory of how Microsoft caught us is correct then there is no mistake that I was caught pirating and I cannot use the \"but they're my legally obtained backups\" argument.  It is, I feel, a legit concern for other game owners to be able to make backups.  If, for instance, all my copies of games were my own backups and the current theory is correct then I probably wouldn't have been caught in this ban wave.  ","c0frk4k":"When you download a game it is usually wise to scan it with a certain program which will patch the iso making it safe for online play.  The database of patches is maintained by the modding community.  The theory is that Microsoft found this site and, acting as fellow modders they, uploaded flagged patches for key games that they knew most people would download, most likely Halo: ODST and FIFA 10.   So anyone who downloaded those games and used the software to patch the iso was flagged and Microsoft saw all of us light up.  After laughing their asses off at us for totally falling for it they brought out the banhammer.  \n\nSo it's not that a new way to mod the xboxs is needed, it's that quality control needs to be put in place for those uploading stealth patches from now on.  Or, don't patch the iso at all and hope to chance that you downloaded a decent iso that doesn't require a patch.

In order to\"unban\" your console, you need firmware from before July 2009, when this was patched. But if you're running older firmware, you couldn't have been on Live to be banned in the first place. From [Xbox Scene](http:\/\/forums.xbox-scene.com\/index.php?showtopic=696317):\n&gt;This method has been known for a long time (since the King Kong Exploit days) and does indeed 'work'. Basically you swap the Keyvault (or 'KV' in short, it stores stuff like console certificates, per-box private keys, DVD key, etc) inside the NAND with the KV from an unbanned console. While technically very different you could somewhat compare it to swapping eeprom data during the Xbox1 days.\n\n&gt;However there's a (really) big 'IF' (besides the required tech knowledge) ... you need the (unique) CPU key of your banned console - without it you can't correctly write (or encrypt if you want) the new KV data in the NAND bin of your banned console.\n\n&gt;Now you wonder how to get the CPU-key ... well by running XeLL of course!\n\n&gt;To run XeLL u need to perform the JTAG hack (or the King Kong exploit, but that's even more outdated) ... and if you got banned the last few weeks it means you updated to the latest dashboard\/kernel (else you can't get on LIVE).\n\n&gt;And that's the problem... Microsoft patched the JTAG hack since kernel 849x (July 2009) ... so no way to boot up XeLL (= no realistic way for you to get the CPU-key atm) and thus no way to swap the KV data in your NAND image.\n\n&gt;And then there's also added KV protection (hashing) on newer motherboards (Falcon+ ? and kernel 1888 won't boot on those), but if you can't even get your CPU-key it doesn't matter much to do deeper into this problem.\n\n&gt;The only way it would work is if you retrieved the CPU-key of your old banned 360 before you updated to anything over 849x. If you did that you probably know about all of this and I'm not telling you anything new. Downgrading kernel is not an option either, older kernels won't boot as both kernel and CB fuses were burned during the various updates MS performed, and you can't bypass that without ... your CPU-key.","c0ft6kh":"Let me respond to your analogy.

I am moving from India and headed to Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I know absolutely no one at Michigan so I get paired up with this random black dude from Detroit.  Now, this is a pretty exciting time for me. I am 17years old, 10,000 miles away from home, in a new country with a very different culture and absolutely loving it! Until my roommate moves in.\n\nHe is this 300 pound short, black guy. Having never really dealt with any people outside my own culture, I am not sure how to react. I introduce myself, we make some small talk and that's pretty much the end of it all. My guess is this guy is pretty reserved and shy and that's fine with me. As time passes, I realize that this guy *never* leaves the room, except to eat or poop. He would be up all night playing his xbox, chatting to random people on the internet and then sleep through all his classes.  But that's his life, so not my problem. \n\nA month passes by and I start detecting a faint smell in the room. I get some air fresheners, start keeping the doors and windows open and atleast the smell is bearable. I also noticed that he was extremely unhygienic. He would have dirty dishes  lying on his bed while he slept next to it, not washing the dishes for weeks at a time.  I bring it up with my roommate a couple of times but he is oblivious to it.  As more time passes, even people in the hallway start noticing the smell. We all figure that this guy never ever showers or does laundry and it's just a toxic mix of deo, febreez  and BO.  What's even worse is that I notice that his bedsheets are stained with jizz and he sleeps in that filth every day. To top it all , it's now November and it starts snowing. So now, I can no longer keep the windows open. \n\nAt this point, I am frequently sleeping over at my friends place, crashing on the couch somewhere because the stench is unbearable. I am finally sick of it and get my RA involved. The RA, the roommate and I sit down and have a discussion on this. My case is pretty simple...take a shower every.single.day. But this guy point blank refuses, with a blunt \"Nah man, I don't do that\". So now, I am *negotiating* with this guy on how often he should bathe himself. I suggest every alternate day but we finally settle on 3 days a week. \n\nHe kept the bathing routine for about a couple of weeks and then went back to his old self. I moved out soon after. \n\nThis was by far the worst roommate experience I have ever had.

Keep in mind, this isn't just a ban on a particular game. This is a ban on the Xbox Live service as a whole, so you won't be able to go online at all during your ban. Initially, you may be banned for a day, a week, or depending on severity, permanently! Kiss that $50 goodbye.\"\n\nIt sounds like they do have sliding scales.

Probably permanently.  \n\nRemember, Microsoft may be a company, but the company is made of people with a customer service department.  If people really felt they were slighted for the wrong reason, they can always call and talk to a representative and have it escalated to managers.  They don't want to alienate people on either side - they want happy customers who pay, but also don't want people cheating or pirating because that may make more unhappy people.\n\nI doubt any company ever WANTs to ban people, that means they make less money.  My friend got banned from Aion coincidentally back when they were banning gold farmers and he was afraid he screwed up, may have said something bad in public or gotten mistaken as a gold farmer.  He freaked out for 2 days calling customer service and they investigated the cause and unbanned him after telling him to change his password.\n\nApparently, someone hacked his account and was using it to spam farm bots.\n\nCompanies want you to play in their yard but they also want other people to play with you.

Servers mostly had player caps that were double or more what the maps were designed for. Most servers were hardcore team deathmatch. It wasn't democratically possible for casual players to decide which game mode to play unless they made listen servers, and there was no matchmaking for those listen servers like there is on Xbox Live. \n\nWhat made Modern Warfare so nice on xbox was that you chose a game mode, and it found a game for you that matched that mode.

It's definitely something I come back to for the multiplayer though, but the Special Ops (basically mission maps with reworked objectives) are awesome and fun to do with friends that aren't good with the multiplayer. Multiplayer is some of the best I've ever played; large variety in map styles, pretty competent people, tons of class customization and weapon\/enhancement options let you really specialize in whatever play style you're good at, while the unlocking rewards make you branch out.

This a common decision consumers make every day as they weigh the pros and cons of their purchase.

Write quality? What is that? Disc images don't have compression codecs like divx, xvid or h.264 - it's either a copy of the disc or it isn't.\n\nSorry I was being vague - there is a reason that copies you make on your home burner does not work on an unmodded xbox.

You seem to be pretty confident that MSFT looks for this information; care to define any of those terms? Please? Waves, in relation to a 'video partition'? Angle? Like, whether the console is standing on the side, or laying flat? Or which of the multiple angles available in the DVD-Video standard is the Xbox game using when the game is being played?\n\nThere are three partions on an xbox DVD-R DL - The game, an update and the video partion. The game is self explanatory, the update disk is where they keep the automatic updates for the xbox. The video partion is where they keep the small video file, the disc plays if you put the disk in, for example a DVD-drive - It says, to play this disk, put it in an Xbox 360 or something like that. The size of this partion is different in the different waves. Wave 1 was one size, and the custom firmware was expecting this size. Microsoft also checks if this video partion is the same as the retail disk. When microsoft changes the video partion, there is a new wave. \n\nThe angle is the way the beam of laser is projected back to the xbox. I don\u00b4t know the specifics, but the xbox is always projecting this back at 359 degrees. The xbox will be suspicious if the angle comes back a perfect 360 degrees, so you have the program abgx360 to correct disk images.\n\nNext, you say that he can play a copied game off-line and it will somehow send this info to MSFT?\n\n&gt; I'm far from an expert on this topic, but having explored the possibility of modding my 360, I can't make sense of any of this, even as a casual observer.\n\nNo one knows exactly how this goes on, but on newer xbox'es there is a simple NAND chip, which stores the information, and sends it, when there is a network connection avaliable.

For one- they aren't canceling anybody's xbox live subscription, no refunds or anything like that are required.

They paid for shipping both ways - they send you a shipping box, you drop it at UPS and shortly thereafter they send you another 360 - or yours repaired.  Keep your HD.  They replaced the drive and gave me a one year warranty on the whole system.  I thought that was pretty good.  Not quite as good as Apple who gave me a refurb iPhone for free after I dropped mine in the toilet but it was fair for an out of warranty problem and the turnaround was quick.\n\nI modded his original xbox, and it still works beautifully, but I've never touched the 360 other than to dust it off once in awhile.","c0g5ekq":"How early?

Doom, released in 1993, was a milestone in gaming. Doom was Wolfenstein turned up to 11. Doom was God's gift to gaming (if you believe in old man deities in the sky).\n\nThree years later, id drops another bomb on the world when it releases Quake. THREE YEARS LATER! Quake, a game that is over a decade old, offers a more competitive gaming experience than any game on any console, ever, and it was released three years after Doom. Quake fucking two is out on Doom's fourth birthday.\n\nAnother important third birthday? On the third birthday of Warcraft 2, Blizzard bestowed upon the world Starcraft.\n\nSo here's my best and worst moments:\n\nBest: Laughing at RROD.\n\nWorst: Watching your favorite pass time, gaming, raped by corporate whores.

I went back and got a different used version 3 separate times until I figured it was the console. Luckily, I had got the service plan so I took it back to Gamestop for a replacement. The dude there was fucking awesome, gave me a new console (WITH the warranty, usually you don't get the warranty automatically after the first one breaks) and he gave me a brand new Oblivion disk. \nSkip ahead two years, RROD. :( Spent an entire summer without my xbox. This gave me the opportunity to get friendly with my game cube again and play Twilight Zelda. So it wasn't too bad. \nAnother year forward, and now my xbox is having problems reading disks. I'm very frightened for her.\n\nBEST: Playing all night rounds of Halo 3 and kicking major ass. NETFLIX. MW2. Discovering everything amazing about the Orange Box and falling in love with Valve. Oblivion, Oblivion, Fallout3. Braid, N+, Castle Crashers.","c0g5zlq":"All I have is anecdotal evidence, but my elaboration would go something like this:\n\n1.) Lately I have met many more gamers than I usually do since graduating college. The first question most of them ask is do I own an xbox or PS3? No one ever asks if I own a Wii. This rules out the wii.\n\n2.) Xbox Live vs PSN. This rules out the Playstation.\n\nErgo, xbox is number one.\n\nReally, it doesn't matter. Xbox could be number one or fifty; I guess the point is that MS has sufficiently locked down the Xbox that people who RROD are very likely to buy another console, and they're very likely to buy another xbox (again, anecdotal evidence).\n\nHow many people have you met that have had RROD and then no longer own an xbox?","c0g60ft":"I disagree greatly and let me explain why. Gaming has come much great leaps as a whole since the era that allowed a 20 man studio to pump out game after game using original engines, graphics and physics. Now we must rely on things such as the the Unreal Engine, HAVOK, Nvidia Physx and Bink to allow even teams of 100+ to produce games in a reasonable time on a decent budget. Games that require their own engines end up costing unreal costs and are only achievable by the best funded projects. \n\nNow since you focused on one engine i will as well and since I don't feel like maxing out my google-fu atm I'll take the easy one ; Unreal Engine 3. You can see [here](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games#Unreal_Engine_3) how far and diverse this engine has been taken on the xbox 360 in 4 years; just like Doom was. I even feel comfortable in saying that it surpasses what Doom achieved and much much more all on the same piece of hardware none-the-less. The jump between Doom and Quake was a double in resources. \n\nYes, with all this new technology we have on our hands we have an even greater window of diversity then ever before that I can agree we are not taking full advantage of but comparing what we have now to what we had in the past is really a pointless debate. Things are much more complex then they ever were but were doing a damn good job of pumping out great titles. \n\nEdit : spelling, grammar.","c0g62ch":"Breakdown. Although it's got some control issues... the game is unbridled genius. You know how immersive Bioshock was? Yeah... not nearly as immersive as Breakdown. There aren't really cut-scenes in the game, the story unfolds as you play the game. There aren't really levels either. Checkpoints for the save system, sure... but there aren't levels or really any elements that would break immersion in the game. \r\n\r\nIt's got a great storyline and some halfway decent voice acting... for the most part. The story though, much better than I expect from videogames, with some great twists... but still solid and enjoyable enough that, paired with the complex but rewarding controls, make the game pretty replayable even though it's highly linear and single player only.\r\n\r\nIt's a first person fighting\/adventure by the way. There are some shooting bits right at the start too... and I have to warn you they really, really blow. But the rest of the game is awesome, the controls are complex but once learned... when you find yourself in a fight (which will be often) the game really shines. From the moment you start a new game to the moment the end credits roll you are in the first person perspective. At no moment do you leave that perspective. When you get hit with an upper-cut and your head snaps back, the camera behaves likewise. To replenish your health, you must pick up, and consume food and drinks. To get ammo from a fallen soldier's gun, you must pull the clip from the gun. \r\n\r\nI could go on and on about this game. Just trust me on this, if you like first person games, and you like challenging games... Breakdown is a must-play. You'll probably be a little sad you didn't play it sooner... in my mind it's the true unknown gem of the last generation. It came from Namco and was xbox exclusive. They took full advantage of the hardware to make a beautiful game that still holds up decently nowadays. It wasn't heavily promoted though, and if memory serves it came out around the time that a bunch of heavy hitters did... so it was easily eclipsed and kind of came and went without too much notice.\r\n\r\nIt's my favorite game of the last generation. And for what it's worth, I played A LOT of games last generation.

You can capture outposts, gain more resources, construct ships, build defensive outposts. The campaign was epic in so many different ways. Multiplayer was a blast also!

I even go as far as to say I like my xbox 360; Gears of war 2 was one of the best gaming expriences I've ever had. \n\n\nBut in the end, I recommend ps3 over xbox (if you want to buy only one of them that is)\n\n\nIn short, if you're a reddittor, chances are you're a nerd &amp; I've found ps3 to be more of a nerd's machine than xbox. here's how. \n\n\nFrst &amp; foremost, there's the internet browser* &amp; almost endless possibilities that comes with it (it's the internets after all). Things like...\n\n* watching youtube on your tv.\n* watching brilliant [pbs documentaries](http:\/\/video.pbs.org\/) on demand &amp; for free, on your tv. \n* watching many more documentaries, hosted on google video. \n* streaming music through sites like grooveshark. \n\nYou figure out the rest. those I listed above are the ones that I enjoy regularly (except for music streaming).\n\n\nYou also said that you're moving to japan. When I first moved abroad, it took me some time to realize how many services I took for granted were not available out of US.  The internet browser allows you to work around some of those. like, if I want to watch a movie, I first check if I can legally pay for &amp; stream\/download it. If I can't, there are many websites that allow me to instantly start watching my favorite movie. Some of them are flash based, but still offer a decent quality &amp; some let you stream\/download the divx version. \n\n\nthe same with tv shows. &amp; believe me, finding your beloved tv show can be a headache if you live outside us. \n\n\nThen there's the media server thing, where you can instantly stream and\/or copy almost all your media files from your pc\/external hard drives, over a wi-fi connection to your ps3. \n\n\nWith Xbox, you can do that too. but you have to  buy a [not-so-cheap](http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/hardware\/buyNow\/x\/xbox360wirelessnetadapter\/) wi-fi adapter. Ps3, however, has that built in.\n\n\nThe whole media server thing is so beautiful, you have to exprience it yourself to get your very own geeky erection; it works so smoothly &amp; can be set up faster than you can imagine.\n\n\nEven if you're not content with media sharing through windows media player, there's always [ps3mediaserver](http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/ps3mediaserver\/), which extends your choices by, for example, allowing you to instantly broadcast, convert &amp; play, your VIDEO_TS folders. \n\n\nThen, there's remote play, which is one of the nerdiest expriences I've had. [See it for yourself](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nOTjB2lPUsw)\n\n\nOptions like this, are the reason I prefer ps3 to xbox. \n\n\nThere are many more arguments in the console war, but the rest really depend on your personal taste. \n\n\nTake exclusives for example; ps3 has uncharted 1 &amp; 2, the last guardian, heavy rain,  God of war and final fantasy, while xbox has gems like gears of war, or Alan wake. \n\n\nThose are all great games. But if I have to choose between them, I will pick uncharted's console becuse I like the way it brings colors back to a brown n gray world of gaming. It's personal, as I said. \n\n\n*The internet browser is not perfect but it works quiet good for me. It supports both java &amp; flash &amp; it allows you to open up to 6 tabs. I haven't had any serious problem with it. However, there are rumprs of replacing this with a firefox designed for ps3. ","c0g6eom":"it is legal for a company to deny you their services for whatever reason they wish. If my landlord evicted me for having a waterbed which i was no allowed to have then that is my fault. And yes they need to give you more notice because 1 day is not long enough to remove your objects from the house and get into another, and there are usually laws to give you this time. There is no law stating that you must be given 30 days notice for your consoles access to xbox live to be terminated. Your internet provider could ban your modem, or cancel your account if they wanted to, for any reason. They reserve this right always in the EULA. ","c0g6f9t":"i don't really see anything unethical or underhanded about it to be honest. I doubt banning earlier would have impacted sales of games, these are people who modded their consoles so they didnt have to pay for games. They still have full access to xbox live on legitimate hardware, just their modified hardware is banned.","c0g6ga7":"I haven't heard any word about a ps4 or xbox 3.  ","c0g6gfl":"This seems like a money making ploy to me and nothing more. If microsofts goal was to prevent piracy they would ban the users xbox live account, or suspend it, thus hurting them and encouraging them to be legit. That user is free to sign up again, but if it detects a modded console then the same thing would happen. Eventually people will get tired and quit playing, give up on xbox live, or go legit. As it is now these people will go buy a new console and wait until next year when they get banned again, rinse, repeat. This does not encourage anyone to stop pirating, it just encourages them to buy a new 360. ","c0g6hhm":"I didn't think of the dlc, that is a good point. What I'm getting at though is that everytime you sign onto xbox live it should do this check (I can't imagine it being resource intensive), and if it suspects a modded console it will lock you out. You can then unmod your console or buy a new one, it would not forever ban that console and force you to buy a new. If you suspect you are wrongfully banned you should be able to call up M$ and quickly have it resolved. \n\nThis is basically how windows piracy is handled, if a banned serial key is detected you cannot get windows updates. They don't disallow your computer from accessing the internet (though maybe they would if that weren't illegal). So in this situation you would either buy a legitatment copy of windows, use a crippled version, or pirate a better copy (there is obviously no equivalent to this on the 360).  \n\nedit: And they would not lose any money on a suspended or banned account, only the rest of that months at most. If they paid a year in advance they'd be refunded for the rest. Obviously this is not advantagous to microsoft as there's little money to be made here, there is however money to be made in forcing people to buy a new console while still paying for their xbox live account even though they can't use it w\/o buying a new system.","c0g6hl5":"The original controller for the original xbox.\n\nFor ones out now the current xbox controller.","c0g6hnf":"the 360 controller, or a Logitech dual-analog gamepad (like the ps2\/xbox style ones that are kinda shaped like a 360 controller, i have a ps\/xbox\/gc usb controller adapter)","c0g6ht0":"The original xbox controller, the big one.","c0g6i6d":"I as emulating it.

It doesn't make sense to me.\n\nI idea you should be going for on a joystick is maximizing the area that the thumb touches at all times. While the concave idea will certainly have more area when the stick is straight up (that's what she said), as soon as it's pushed in any direction, the area is reduced to a sliver along the edges (unless you turn your thumb). With the convex idea (duke controller) the area is mostly the same in all directions of the joystick, which means consistency.\n\nedit: typo","c0g6jay":"agree @ PS, but disagree @ SNES\n\nYou forgot to mention how hard\/weird that D-pad was on the PS controllers. I don't know whether it was a coincedence, but every time I played PS at a friend's house (never owned a playstation of any sort, unless you count emu) my hand was really tense throughout the whole experience. Joystick placement was horrible and the D-pad needed too much pressure to work. The buttons were okay, but the 'triggers' were also nothing compared to the later xbox\/xbox360 triggers.

And nobody's shorting MicroSoft's stock.\n\nBut that never actually happened, right? Undercutting is a *myth,* right? And even if MicroSoft did subsidize one business unit with the profits from another, it would *never* lead them to a dominant position in the video game industry, would it?\n\nThat's *not possible*, is it?\n\n\nUndercutting is more myth than reality, huh?

It got to ingrained that hextor was the server, so as I got new desktop, the old desktop became the server and the server became 2nddesktop, 2nddesktop blew up or scavanged for parts or given away, and as such the names also got pushed around the systems so I didn't have to update hundreds of DNS entries. So they aren't really emotionally attached.\n\nNew systems are just:\n\n* xbox.local\n* psp.local\n* ds.local (game systems obviously)\n* mobile.local (android HTC Magic device)\n* laptop.local\n\nI would prefer to have:\n* server.local\n* desktop.local (well I might keep that named since its personal)\n* desktop2.local. (or workstation.local, family.local or something).\n\nAlso it makes more sense to have DNS names for services rather than specific machines so that way you can use virtual machines for specific services as desired, or switch to external services. I haven't gotten around to it yet:\n* nfs.local, samba.local, nfs.local (this way if you brought a NAS that didn't support all those services, you could tunnel through a different machine).\n* ssh.local (obviously each system will have an ssh, but for the main external ssh server).\n* ntp.local (Want to run a local ntp server, great, decide to switch to an external one, just update the host entry, don't reconfigure dozens of systems).\n* printer.local\nIn reality those would all resolve to server.local, but it makes it future proof.\n\nAlso remember that in the future hardware itself will start to become addressable. It's happening with things like bluetooth and future systems like lightpeak and PANs might push it. So you will have things like harddrive1.desktop.local, harddrive2.desktop.local, usbthumbdrive.workstation.local, digitalcamera.workstation.local, and you have the option of pushing a harddrive across your entire network like a NAS. Although that example has some problems since you might take harddrive2 and stick it in a different computer, so they will need some kind of more permanent name, like volumelabel.local (ie storage3.local), uuidhash.local (a full UUID wouldn't be very nice).\n\nI suppose the next thing on might be a way to make individual partitions available by having the harddrives server bind multiple addresses. With a public domain name and IPv6 giving each device a unique ip address, you could access a USB (or lightpeak) thumbdrive plugged in at home from your work. [https:\/\/part1.volumelabel.homedomain.com\/](https:\/\/part1.volumelabel.homedomain.com\/). Of course need a drive with it's own server built in (but a webserver on a chip is like $1 to make).\n\nYou have to start to take into account security. I would recommend a VPN but that causes problems for roaming, if you take your thumbdrive from home to work you don't want a different hostname or to tunnel through your house, how do you ensure that hundreds of old devices don't have vulnerabilities. You also have to ensure that the network your connecting through is setup to assigned a local ip and route directly to the device (although if it doesn't the device could be setup to tunnel through your home network as a backup). I'm sure workplaces will avoid this since they won't want rogue devices allowing external access to their network but as things like mobile phones will start to bridge external networks more they will end up with it anyway. so you could have a standard where the network has a server and a set of protocols so only the networks server has to be up to date and you talk through that, then there is the harddrives server for added security in case the networks server is our of date or untrusted.","c0g9p7z":";( my graphics card died in my arms last week...\n  Anyone know when it's expected for xbox live?","c0g9pm0":"-1 for lack of back story &amp; still nothing from \"ZahraAnW\". \n\nI can only conclude that a hacked xbox was sent in.

And while they aren't known for shelling out $50.00 for headline games like Modern Warfare 2, they still matter.  Look at Wii, that entire console caters to the polar opposite to the \"hardcore gamer\" and it does fine financially.  \r\n\r\nFurther, speculating that the steam numbers are full of hot air (LOL) because steam is free, is kind of a shot in the dark. IMO Steam's being free is probably more likely to provoke purchases of games than say a subscription to xbox-live.  \r\n\r\nAlso, steam numbers arent the be all end all of PC gaming.  ","c0ga45o":"If you are planning to buy xbox 360 repair guide from 3RedLightFix.com. It'd be recommended to read informative review from this site.","c0ga6zb":"They can...it's their property. But if they do, and go outside of what microsoft deemed acceptable initially when the purchase was made, microsoft shouldn't have to fix it. That's why there are warranties and you can void them. Hypothetically speaking, if a kid opens his xbox and fucks up the motherboard trying to install a modchip, it's not microsoft's responsibility to fix it.\n\nIf the kid sends it in anyway, costing microsoft money on shipping when he knows his damaging of the system isn't covered for them to fix, he's in the wrong first.\n\nWow, never thought I'd defend the corporation.","c0ga746":"* serverbox\n* mainbox\n* xbox\n* xbox360\n* lappy\n* crappy (the mac)\n* pockie","c0ga75n":"I'm lucky enough that they have an expired card of mine. I've looked long and hard but have come up with nothing.  I'm still getting e-mails to this day about my (original xbox) live account and how it will \"expire if I dont renew it soon!\"\n\nFuck them.","c0ga8dg":"LOL odd that you just posted this because i just got off the phone with them a hour ago. I called them because i turned off auto renew and got billed neway last yr but could afford it so i was like o well ill enjoy another year of xbox live. SO anyways... i just called and asked that after turning off my renew if it was going to then charge me next month even  tho i turned it off. He said No..so i responded with \"Are you sure cuz last year it did and i dont have the money to pay you people this year\" and he said no no it wont charge you and just hung up. I HATE the xbox live support and i am sure im on there shit list since i have called b4.","c0ga8k5":"Im amazed that one guy says he got his money back.\n\nI had stupidly let my older brother use my credit card for his original xbox. When it came to renewal time he kept saying he would deal with it but never did so they charged me. I phoned up and explained that my brother was a no good deadbeat who should've cancelled the account and they told me that they would cancel it now but I would only NOT be getting a refund but the account would no longer work as soon as I cancelled it. 364 days of live account wasted. \n\nOn my own 360 account I have had a similar problem. I was about to buy a years subscribtion code as I received a \"your account is nearly out of game time\" type email. So I was about 1 click away from buying an instant code when I decided to wait till the old account expired. Just as fucking well I did because I logged onto my account through the 360 and it said I had been charged. \n\nYeah it's my fault because I had bought an arcade game and forgotten I had put a new CC on there but GO FUCK YOURSELF MICROSOFT. Don't send me a warning email when you already have my damned money.","c0gabcu":"Felt sad for the girlfriend, the xbox and the guy ... sad\r\nshe could have sold it on eBay, donate to a charity - but no, destroying it made more sense.\r\n\r\n","c0gabso":"So he got home at 5:30 so its ok to assume he was at his job working. What did she do...have time to video tape herself destroying a xbox.","c0gaci8":"I'm a PC gamer, and i basically don't buy games any more. I feel like gaming topped out a while back, and most new games are so short that they don't offer enough bang for buck, or WOW clones that require you to dedicate your entire life to playing it. There are a few titles i'm interested in, but generally i've been playing Battlefield 2 (still), A little crysis, Mass Effect, and a LOT of battlefield bad company for xbox (one of the greatest games made in the last 3 years if you like online shooters).","c0gad6p":"Ya def sounds like a bandwith issue, prehaps a worm.... do you have a splitter? if so make sure it is the correct one DB6 i believe if your ISP is time warner.\n\nDo you have any restrictions on your router, such as a MAC filter, QoS configuration or port restrictions\/triggering? Have you checked your cabling..... are you using old coax or Ethernet cables? you might as well purchase new cat6 cables if you havent already... Are you playing L4D2 on a pc or xbox? there is quite more information needed.... is it a wireless connection? if so have you checked if it is conflicting with nearby broadcasts? If so set your broadcast to a channel 11 b\/g mixed, what about a local firewall or av? i know pos like norton will only prompt like once to create exceptions for applications? if your neighbor was experiencing issues as well you could have a tear in your neighborhood cabling infrastructure ","c0gaerd":"MW2 is okay.  If I had a choice I would have L4D2.  The xbox does not belong to me.","c0gaey6":"If i buy an xbox and replace it with my xbox thats not working and then return it.. any chance theyll find out?","c0gaftj":"Does [this](http:\/\/jalopnik.com\/5395642\/toyotas-gullwing-door-monster-xbox-halo-warthog-pickup-truck-concept) atrocity make them lose your respect?","c0gague":"It will still have lower texture quality than the xbox.","c0gai2e":"I'm going to get drunk and play xbox.","c0galkj":"Honestly for the most part you don't really get trolls. All the talk about xbox live chat when halo was out made me a bit anxious when I got my ps3 and started playing call of duty but honestly it wasn't bad. \n\nFor the most part nobody really uses voice chat and if they are they're either talking to friends or trying to set up a strategy letting you know where snipers are etc. They could also be speaking some indian language but I only seem to run into that during the 11pm and past hours.","c0galqp":"Same caliber?  You add friends, and invite them to your game or join theirs.  It's not more complicated than that on my xbox, unless I'm missing something.  (I play them both) PS3 didn't do the whole Mii thing with their interface though with little cute characters for all your friends.  If you're crazy about that stuff, hey to each his own.  I don't see any more trolls on PSN than XBL.  I certainly don't see as many dumb little kids on there as Xbox live though.\nExclusives: Metal Gear, Heavenly Sword, Killzone 2, Uncharted (1,2), Infamous, Resistance 1,2, God of War 3(coming soon), etc.  Then you have all the multiplatform games.  This system is solid, man.  I like it a lot. ","c0gan63":"Look at it this way.\n\nWhen you buy an xbox 360, it's yours, I hope we can agree on that.\n\nMicrosoft, by locking 3rd party products, is saying, \"fuck you it's our property still.\"","c0gao7t":"**xbox360**","c0gappi":"I know it's meant as a joke here but I hate articles framed in the form \"X murdered Y over facebook\/ps3\/xbox\". It's never as simple as one little thing causing the event in practice, it's usually a bunch of background stuff that comes to a head at some point.","c0gapyk":"sure, once the user purchases the product, its theirs. \n\nbut i have no sympathy for datek unless they actually bought a right to develop hardware. if they did no such thing, they should have realized in the first place that they could potentially get screwed by a software lockout. for the users, i do have sympathy because theyre getting owned, and effectively have no recourse other than to mod their xbox, or buy a card.  its one of those buyer beware type deals, where the buyer got screwed, but then again, they will probably not buy a future microsoft console and spread the word, thus punishing microsoft albeit probably a small punishment. ","c0gaqac":"Well the the way it was for me was this:\r\n\r\nI played nintendo from about 88-91\r\nGot SNES and played that from 91-95\r\nGot N64 and playstation in 96 and played that till about 2001\r\nGot a ps2 and played that off and on somewhere in that time too\r\nAround 2001 i saved enough cash (about 900$) for a new PC.  After discovering half-life and counter-strike around 99 i HAD to have a PC but  was too into school etc to work and just played a friend's. \r\n\r\nAfter discovering PC.  It's multitasking abilities, convenience, and keyboard\/mouse controls i really never touched a console from then on.  Pc's are more expensive but they offer more. As i gamed on PC i also noticed how half assed a lot of console interfaces and games were and they just didnt interest me anymore.  That may sound pretentious but i find consoles are the \"McDonald's\" of the gaming world.  They offer strictly gaming, are isolated from any modability, and serve as an \"off\/on\" experience. \r\n\r\na PC on the other hand again, offers modable games, more rich online experiences, and is just a better medium for me.\r\n\r\nConsoles can have their place but if you ask me, if you want a gaming medium that offers more creative potential, social potential, and content delivery potential, i say go with a PC. \r\n\r\nI think the only reason consoles are still wtih us today is affordability.  I, personally  see no other reason why you'd buy one aside from the pricing.  But for me, give me a 1,100 PC over a 300$ xbox any day.\r\n\r\nThat was pretty much all random diatribe but that'll give you a bit of a view inside an \"Anti-Console\" brain haha.  \r\n","c0gaqfv":"I think it's because most online multiplayer FPSers use xboxes","c0gas5t":"Yea I don't get this either.  It seems the PC people are always talking shit about fanboys but they are the biggest ones in here.  I am like you I have a PS3, xbox 360 and a gaming PC.  I like them all.  Sometimes I want to hide in my office and play some good games on my pc, other times I want to lounge on my couch and play games with my friends.  I mean seriously they all have their strong and weak points.","c0gaszf":"Yup.  Very good console.  Customizable in ways the xbox is not as well. ","c0gat3d":"See, I'm reading other reviews stating the game is actually decent. That the controls are quite simple:\n\nhttp:\/\/xbox360.gamezone.com\/gzreviews\/r38120.htm\n\nI'm not a console player, but if this got enough good reviews, I'd buy one just so I could play this or Skate - I love skating games.","c0gave6":"this on xbox live is fffunnnn... in moderation hehe","c0gaya0":"If you have a PC capable of playing dragon age, or ever plan on getting one, don't get it for xbox.","c0gayhd":"so what makes you think that the memory cards couldn't  be used to crack the copyright protection on the xbox360? ","c0gb13v":"uh no dude there are cards out there that have hdmi built in. there are also dvi to hdmi adapters that are way cheap. and who said anything about a work pc? Last time i checked, if you have a ps3\/xbox360, your going to have a computer bought within the last 4 years.","c0gb17s":"You can remove the entire xbox casing (with the serial sticker) and switch it with another 360, even if one has HDMI and the other doesn't.\n\n","c0gb1oh":"I had thps2X on the xbox, it had all the content of 1 and 2 in a single game.  It was quite awesome.","c0gb3bm":"id go for the PS3 just on the fact that the lifespan of the PS3 is still in first half of its life cycle. \n\nthe next xbox will drop shortly maybe as soon as next xmas. So the xbox 360 is at the end of its life cycle .\n\nPlus a 54% failure rate of Xbox 360's isn't making it a smart purchase. ","c0gb3uk":"They give zero fucks about two fucks who sent in a hacked xbox.","c0gb4fv":"Let me guess you own an xbox and your pc struggles to run a web browser.","c0gb4gj":"Man that xbox really held together under her weak golf club smashing fit. I bet the ring of death would still turn on... I'd morph the broken xbox into a twisted brain killing machine called \"The XBocx\" in 2892. It'd later be featured in a film of the same name. It may or may not kill her.","c0gb4u3":"Yeah, xbox 360 is just like the xbox with a couple new shading effects too. You're right, it isn't a very big deal.","c0gb53x":"word. right after my daughter was born we decided this. she got me an xbox. i got her nothing.","c0gb67o":"DVDA was my xbox gamer tag","c0gb6c6":"They did a solid job porting the game, but it plays better with a controller **if you are used to using one**.\n\nI got along fine without it, but I tried it on my brothers PC with his xbox controller (though I couldn't really get used to it that quick), I could see that in certain situations a controller would be handier than a keyboard.","c0gb7s3":"Well, tell WOW Company to Ban you. \n\n[getxboxcodes.com](http:\/\/Getxboxcodes.com)","c0gbbvf":"xbox-live I bet.","c0gbg19":"didn't buy it either.  There was a whole bunch of COD4 servers telling me not to buy it, reddit told me not to buy it and having played a bit on xbox, I no longer want to buy it.","c0gbl6q":"You have to send your penis into microsoft to get repaired. Don't worry, as long as it's still under warranty you'll get a free month-long trial xbox live account.","c0gbpbz":"I have both systems but if I could only have one gaming system it would be an xbox.  Mine gets loads of use (I don't have cable tv so I play it every night) and it's never failed.  I prefer the xbox exclusives like L4D over uncharted 2, and yes I've played both plenty.  The xbox is far better in terms of software.  The menu system is better and the downloadable arcade games, like splosion man and geometry wars are better than anything the PS3 has.  \n\nFinally, the xbox comes with mics.  This is a mixed blessing because the xbox community really is filled with jerks.  However, now that I have a nice group of friends we can communicate with each other, call out bad guys, ask for help, etc.  It's a huge part of the game.  On the ps3 not having a mic is the norm so even if you have one there is nobody to talk to.  People sometimes get one, realize they are alone, and ditch it.  By not shipping a mic with the ps3 it never got the critical mass it needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the ps3 is a blu-ray player so that's part of the reason we bought it.  It finally caught up to the xbox in terms of netflix integration but it does suck that it needs a disc to work. I've had my xbox long enough that I no longer worry (much) about RROD but being on sites like this does make me feel better about the ps3 hardware reliability.  \n\nFor graphics performance, there is no difference.  Don't let anybody lie to you and say there is, they are just fanboys. 90% of the games are identical on both systems while some look slightly better on the xbox and some look slightly better on the ps3.  Also, msft sometimes does things to take care of their customers (or screw ps3 users depending on your outlook) like buy exclusive content. For example, they will get the new mw2 maps before ps3 users do.\n\nAnyway, to answer your original question none of the major console makes have said a single word about a new console coming out.  Rumor sites have said 2011 but now I'm seeing 2012.  Your timing is fine.","c0gbpjs":"&gt;&gt; The biggest reason I picked the PS3 over xbox was for the blu ray player but from what I hear sooner or later xbox is getting one too.\n\nSteve Balmer said something a few weeks ago that implied the xbox would get a blu-ray player and it got a lot of traction on the net.  A day or two later a msft spokesman corrected it and said that they felt like blu-ray wasn't going to last long and favored their downloadable 1080p alternative.  They made it pretty clear and official that the xbox was not getting blu-ray.\n\nNow they could be lying so that current console sales don't dry up but I think it's more likely that they aren't.","c0gbpqr":"For a small fee, I can fix the xbox. Yet, I can get rid of her for free.","c0gbqn8":"Except his wasn't a normal xbox, it was an xbox development kit.  Not sure why he did that.  Maybe it's easier to open or has more room?","c0gbrqi":"id break her xbox","c0gbtj4":"FWIW, in real life I have one friend with a RROD and one with a broke ps3 so it's even.  Having said that, it's pretty clear from the stats on the web that the ps3 is the more reliable console.  It's less clear to me if the current xbox chipset is less reliable than the ps3. MSFT has made a lot of improvements from the original design but their reputation is still in jeopardy.  \n\nThings have changed. 1) Xbox 360's are more reliable. 2) PS3's are actually cheaper if you need a wireless lan and play online.\n\nEdit: Xbox's are more reliable than they used to be.  I'm not saying they are more reliable than PS3's.","c0gbuor":"Am I the only one that thinks this is totally staged? The xbox was probably RROD'd already.","c0gbxhw":"Private trackers are where its at. Takes a li'l work to get into, but once you're in, its warez paradise.

Xbox charges you for EVERYTHING. Even to go online.  Get a PS3.  do it for the benefits.\n\nYou can change your hard drive to something like a 500Gb hard drive if you're willing to spend a couple extra bucks.\n\nYou have a internet browser built in.\n\nYou can run Linux.\n\nWhat more do you need, it even reads blu ray disks.\n\nxbox cant do that for shit.","c0gc5co":"Go with what most of your friends have, simple as that.\n\nSay what you want about the PS3 network being free, if none of your friends have a PS3 you'll be stuck playing the kiddies while your friend are having fun.\n\nAnd even if you RRO'd, you have games and accessory, why waste them?\n\nI own the 3 consoles, and frankly, I NEVER use the PS3 browser, and Linux is fun whole the novelty last, which isn't very long. I did, however, rent movies on the XBox, and bought quite my share of indie games. \n\nThe only real advantages to the PS3 are the blu-ray and the fact that the PS3 will have a longer shelf life than the 360 (although this didn't mean much for the PS2 in North America)\n\nedit : I should add that my xbox RRO'd yesterday, but I am still in the 3 years extended deal. I still preach for the XBox, because despite it's flaw the service and the presentation of that service is superior than the PS3 (the PS3 UI is the worse crap ever done). Also, mandatory install for games SUCK! It piss me off when I want to show off a newly bought game to someone and we have to sit through a 20 minutes installation!","c0gc6vk":"Yes. And part of it is because I see that they are not doing a great job marketing.

Thats cause ive been Uncharted and Ratchet and Clanking. ","c0gc9ok":"You should have done this as a poll and let the community decide without instigating flame wars then.\nOn a personal note, they're both great systems, I own both. The xbox has the larger library, only because it's been out longer, and the online play is much better on xbox. However, I prefer the ps3 because the system exclusives are much better, and the controller is just perfection imo. Plus, there aren't that many system exclusives anymore, and the ps3 is a MUCH MUCH nicer piece of hardware. I would highly suggest finding a 60gb model though, because the newer ones can't even play ps2 games. the 60gb's did everything except jerk you off while you ski down mount everest on a plank of wood while a gang of pirates try to catch you and gang rape you.","c0gca0b":"I was 15 when I first played doom 3 on the original xbox. My sister was 12. The games SO much scarier when your a youngin'.\n\nThe first F.E.A.R game was quite scary too, it permanently made me afraid of ladders.","c0gchag":"I use both EA's digital system, Valve's and Impulse, I prefer Valve more because of simplicity and it's all in the same place (the store, the games, updates etc.). I'd use it regardless of who made it if it was on par. The closest thing to it is Impulse which is sadly not even close since you can buy games and they don't auto attach to your account, you have to do that manually even from within the app.\n\nas far as banning accounts go, i've never heard of them doing that, but am aware that they can. if you're flirting with an account loss steam is not for you, which seems like a no brainer. just like people who mod their xbox's shouldn't be shocked when they get banned from live. \n\nconsidering the drm employed by valve is ultimately some of the best (excluding non-drm apps) it's hard to beat. things like secur-rom or games that are only installable 3 times are so much more of a dick up the ass for consumers.

There's probably going to be tiered service like xbox gold\/silver with subscription, and games might be unreasonably priced.\n\nI know I'm talking out of my ass, but I'm basing this off the little information I have.

The big problem is that I have three other friends who I played L4D with. They all have xboxes. I want the PC version, because I just prefer mouse and keyboard over controller for FPSs, and once they release the SDK, there's going to be some cool mods. So do I spend $40 on the xbox version (it's on sale on amazon today)? Do I buy the PC version, and not play with my friends? Do I buy both? Or do I wait for an even bigger price drop longer down the road?","c0gd0wu":"Buy the xbox version, play with your friends and grab the pc version when the inevitable weekend deal gives it for 20 bucks.\n\nThis also gives time for the modmakers to make said cool mods. :)","c0gd4wb":"I actually rented the xbox version and I've played through all of the campaigns on normal, and I actually got pretty used to the controls. If you swipe the crosshairs over a target as you fire, you generally score a hit.

Tried to buy an xbox360 off e-bay using paypal. Paid the guy his $350 or whatever it was, then he disappeared off the face of the earth.\n\n\nBasically spent maybe 2 or 3 weeks wringing my hands, worrying, plumbing the depths of e-bay\/paypal User Agreements, FAQs, forums, you name it. \n\n\nEventually I got fed up and just had my credit card company reverse the payment when paypal didn't really do shit to help me. I realized if I went through the whole process with them it would have taken who knows how many more weeks and I probably would have gotten boned in the end.\n\n\nTLDR: I never could figure out all paypal's rules, so I just had my credit card company do a chargeback and I've never logged in to my paypal account since.\n\nI assume if I ever tried to use them again, I'd have a $350 fee waiting to bite me.

I think it was roughly $400 at the time after everything.  I did this with the intent to sell it on ebay, as my friend was waiting for one for himself, I said why not.  I put it up on ebay, it sold, and all was looking good.  I had some previous experience with ebay and was aware of some of the scams out there, but not all apparently.  \nThe series of events worked like this:\nAuction sold &gt; exchange information with buyer &gt; Everything looks good to go, buyer sends me money via paypal for full purchase &gt; I wait 24 until it's in my account (not a pending transaction) &gt; I mail out the xbox 360 &gt; I recieve email from paypal telling me that this credit card was reported stolen &gt; Funds in full removed from my account &gt; (get this) % fee for transaction not removed from my account &gt; Call up shipping company (postal service, regret this now) and it's too late for them to stop the package &gt; \"buyer\" recieves xbox, paypal charges me for the transaction that never happened.\n\nIt took over an hour to finally convince someone at paypal of the absurdity of this transaction fee, and I had used their long distance number off their website which cost me almost as much as the transaction fee in the end.  At the end of the call the person told me \"Oh, next time, we have a toll free number.  We just don't have it on the site.\"\nDO YOU HONESTLY THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE A NEXT TIME?  \nI mean, obviously paypal wasn't entirely malicious in this situation, but I blame them 100% for providing a perfect scamming medium to get away with this.\n\n","c0gdz1u":"check if its inside the 3 yr warranty, and send it off.

Will is attempting (poorly) to show how people are in control of their own destiny. He outlines making a plan, and once you actually commit to that route, you can shape your future until you get where you want.\n\nIt's a fairly optimistic and almost seemingly absurd idea, but if you put it into context it's a little easier to wrap your head around (not in a demeaning way either, it's actually fairly complex). Say, for example, you wanted to become famous. Well first, define famous. There are a number of ways to be famous. As an athlete, sports fans will know all about you, as a professor or researcher, you can be famous based on your research, as an actor or actress, a noble prize winner, a Christian Rock singer, the inventor of disc golf, the designers of building, bridges, etc, etc. There are so many variations of famous. Once you find where your strengths are, you can focus on that path. As you meet people along the way and get closer to your goal, as long as you stay committed and never give up, you truly can shape your future. And while I believe Will takes it a little far, since there can only be one on top so not everyone can shape an ideal future; his message I think is that \"if we can identify our strengths and use them to work towards a goal, then we really can achieve them...\" what we lack is the will to sacrifice and the will to fail to settle. Look at your life, if you really wanted your dream, and spend most of your time, every day, pursuing that dream, ignoring how long it'll take, how boring the process is, putting off TV, xbox, world of warcraft, wii and Hulu, and really getting on it. Could you get to your goal? How about damn close?\n\nI think that's what Will's trying to convey; but shit, I'm so god damn baked outta my mind right now, I hardly make sense to myself.

On friday I finally pulled the trigger on a full dedicated component after deploying numerous boxes over the years- including AppleTV, a Dell upgraded w\/ an HDMI interface &amp; PVR running MythTV, HP Media Center Box (for a client), and finally Windows 7 on my laptop.  \n\n\nYou've got three major choices to make here:\n1. Software- what will run the hardware; note many of the packages can integrate\/interface to other packages to boot\n\n2. Primary Hardware- what will I run the primary system on\n\n3.

Hardware\n\n- Start w\/ an appliance type device such as Apple TV or an XBOX and upgrade the software (so popular I made it a separate option)\n\n- Off the shelf dedicated media hardware (can be expensive, limtied options)- HP, Dell, etc.\n\n- Off the shelf general purpose hardware, customized (Linux, Windows, or Apple based) just adding a couple of interface cards to the box\n\n- Build your own; I recommend Newegg for your hardware source.  \n\nThere are a ton of guides and communities with sample specs out there so feel free to RTFGS.\n\nLong story short, I recommend you build your own hardware: you can get a component type box w\/ the options and features that are important to you- (ex: Interface options [HDMI, Component, ATSC\/QAM], with a remote, quiet or close to it, chassis options, ram\/processor speed).  I just ordered a new box on Friday and have attached my purchase list from Newegg w\/ brief explanations at the end of this post.  It'll fit in to my meda center and tie into the whole system quite nicely.  If it's designed correctly you can run either Linux or Windows &amp; Boxee, XBMC, MythTV, or Windows Media Center on it.

Long story short if you don't know what you're doing, that $600 is a cheap way of getting your data back (though recovery STARTS there - if the drive motor is dead or they need to platter swap you're going to get a bill closer to $1000-$1200).

Here's some quick suggestions:\n\nMac drives often will stop mounting on OSX while the hardware itself is still fine - try getting an external SATA enclosure FIRST and hooking it up to a pc with Macdrive installed (demo available online :).

If the drive makes sounds or doesn't show up as a drive, follow below...\n\nplug in power to sata and turn on - what sounds does it make? If you don't know how or can't figure out how to remove your hard drive from your mac, stop reading here, and forget about messing with the drive yourself - take to pro.\n\n1. motor turning? Click, click, click? drive heads are likely dead. You can try getting an identical drive as defined [here](http:\/\/www.datarecoverystory.com\/2009\/06\/the-donor-for-drive\/) and swap the controller; try ebay, hd might cost you $150 shipped. If that doesn't work, take to pro - you try swapping out head first time no practice on a laptop drive your hard drive is gone.\n\n2. Does the motor turn? if you feel no motor vibrations and you get a light click-click motor could be seized (pretty bad - sometimes you can free the motor by opening the drive up and carefully rotating platter **in a clean room** and get data back) and heads are staying parked, or motor is dead (very, very bad - get new drive, swap platter - no chance an untrained unpracticed person can do this and it's $1000-$1200 for a pro to mess with that). \n\n3. No sound at all? dead board, firmware issue, possibly burnt \/ shorted pre-amp on the drive head. If you have a seagate you can make a serial interface circuit like [this](http:\/\/www.xboxhacker.net\/index.php?PHPSESSID=37e5e233c9d59a8b1b4791b4d1f8239d&amp;topic=580.msg5803#msg5803) using the extra service pins on the drive and test the board - this will at least tell you what the board is seeing. A quick search will give you some standard commands you can enter to attempt basic firmware recovery - but mess this up and your hard drive recovery cost could double or you loose the drive. Again you can try as above and swap the board out, it's worth a try at least. \n\nIf you lived in Toronto I'd say bring it in and we could go through it, but I think you're a ways away..","c0gim3s":"The lens added more to her feet than it did to her chest sadly.

I'll highlight some of my favorites here:\n\n* No need for batteries on the controllers, and you can even charge them on any usb port!\n\n* Speaking of usb ports, everything that plugs into a usb, can plug into a ps3!\n\n* Oh no, your microphone that you want to use to talk smack during Modern Warfare two is blue tooth? Oh wait, ps3 does that too!\n\n* Want to stream movies over your network from your external hardrive or an old computer used as a media-box? No problem! Windows 7 makes it easy out of the box, or you can use TVersity (free, obnoxiously easy to set up) if you run vista or xp (or maybe even linux now? I'm actually not sure on this).\n\n* Piggy backing on the TVersity thing, you can log in to a hulu or youtube account through TVersity, and then use it to watch streaming media that way too!\n\n* Blue ray? Probably been covered, but at the time of launch, the ps3 was the cheapest blue ray player. Today, although that is no longer the case, the ps3 is still comparable (price wise) to any other blue ray player on the market. The only difference is that the ps3 is a fucking ps3, and not just some boring blue-ray player.\n\n* Oh wait, you might want to actualy play a *video game* on that new ps3 you got? Well get excited that ps3 has been blowing both the wii and the 360 out of the water in terms of ps3 exclusive titles, in addition to the growing number of shared platform titles. Some exclusives to get you thinking: Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, Uncharted 1 and 2. \n\n* $299. You could either buy a blue-ray player and build yourself a media-box for a lot more work and hassle, or just buy a ps3. Kinda sells itself. \n\n\n* No xbox live bullshit. If the game has online multiplayer, you get to play it. For free (except for any mmos i guess?). Add 2 years of XBL ($100), and you now have the exact same price as the \"wildly expensive and overpriced ps3\"\n* Lastly, I would want to add how beautiful they look. I've got the old humongous one, but the shiny finish always makes me smile. The new ones are even more slick looking, and I've heard that they run a little quieter too (this wasn't ever a problem for me, unless I had the ps3 on without the tv on...which was never...)\n\nHope you look into it!

Neither.\n\nI can only afford to maintain one gaming system, and for me that has to be the PC. I just never really liked the limitations of console gaming. Case in point: Games with mod support. Oblivion and Fallout 3 are prime examples. Also, I much prefer keyboard and mouse as a control schema for most of my games, since I do enjoy being able to play RTS games occasionally, and first person shooters and RPGs are just so much better with keyboard and mouse. Also, Dragon Age on the PC is definitely superior to its console counterparts.\n\nEdit: My point is that there is never a clear winner. It depends completely on the person who owns said gaming systems, and what they want out of their gaming experience. I would probably choose the PS3 though, if I could afford to maintain another system, simply because of the fact that the exclusive games on the PS3 are far more attractive to me than the exclusives on the xbox.

On the other hand, I can think of several titles on the PS3.\n\nEdit 2: Actually, the Wii is also a fairly attractive option, since games like Smash Brothers Brawl look like they're really fun to play with friends on the same television.","c0gj3q3":"I do see you frustration and was essentially trying to explain the various reasons he may have.

In all honesty (didn't read the rest of the comments so I don't know if someone else mentioned this) but awhile ago Tycho brought up a good point during one of their podcasts.  I think a lot of the \"fanboyish\" nature boils down to the fact that these fanboys, for whatever reason, could only afford one system and one system only and that's it.  So in order to justify their purchase they became their respective systems fanboys.  \n\nIn all honesty each system has it's pros and cons.  I prefer online play on the PS3 because A. it's free and B. i don't know why but i've come across fewer douchebags as opposed to the zestpool that is xbox live.  I'm not a big fan of playing online on my Xbox for that very reason.  Only now is the PS3 FINALLY coming into its own with its games.  I own all the systems because it provides me with unlimited options however if I were to pick my current favourite it would be the PS3.  I love the free online play, I love being able to play old PS1 games like FF7 and Tactics on it.  I love Wipeout HD as it's one of my favourite gaming franchises.  Right now it's great.  But that's just my personal opinion.  \n\nAt the end of the day it boils down to games and your budget.  What games you want to play and can you afford two systems.

Secret Santa, my name is Ben, I'm a 28 year old technical support engineer and a new father from Minnesota. My wife and I had our son 3 weeks ago, and I'm enjoying being a new dad. I went to school for manufacturing engineering, and I enjoy computers &amp; electronics. I worked in that field originally and my computer &amp; programming skills led me to where I am today. I grew up in a creative family, so I also enjoy performing musical theater, abstract painting and design. I grew up playing with Legos, which was a fun way to develop my technical and creative sides. I do some freelance web development, and like making stuff at my workbench whether it's my homemade wine &amp; mead or soldering together an electronics project. My wife and I play Dr. Mario regularly with an NES emulator on my original (modded) xbox. I ran ethernet through the walls of my house and proudly show off my network cabinet and ethernet\/phone\/cable TV jacks in several rooms of the house.\n\nThings I like...

Warning and disclaimer: I talk a lot, so even my Coles Notes version may be kind of long  :-) If you make your way to the bottom, you win a cookie!\n\n\nI was a Canadian transplant, living in England for medical school, and so I flew to Italy for a few weeks, to the small town my family is from, to attend their annual summer festival and eat some pasta with the relatives. That's where I found him. \n\n\nI was more interested in red wine and dancing to bad Italian music, than I was in boys- - especially since my only dating experience was one long term relationship where I was little else to the guy, but a wallet to fund his xbox habit- - and so I didn't expect to like him.  I was sitting on a bench with my sisters, people watching, and he walked right by me, without noticing me at all. Very truthfully, he was-- and still is-- the most beautiful man I have ever seen! &lt;fight urge to insert 45 hot pictures, here&gt;.\n\n\n As luck would have it, he was with a group of people that had Canadian flags on their backpacks, and my large mouth proceeded to scream out (or slur, out, after all the red wine) \"Yayyyy, Canada!!!\", which didn't seem to impress him. I thought, that being supremely gorgeous, he must of course be supremely stupid, but after about 5 seconds of conversation (and a glance at his engineering iron ring) I was kind of annoyed to find out that wasn't the case. It's much easier when they're pretty and vapid, because then you don't want to drag them home with you, and keep them.  I realized, that not only was he not vapid, but he was brilliant, which instantly appealed to my intellectual whore side.  We became fast friends-- or at least, I did with him- - and spent many a night chatting about life, the Universe, and everything, and continued to email each other once we were back in Canada. And we've talked almost every day, since.\n\n\nSomewhere, in between the teasing insults he gave me, I fell for the guy. Overall, he changed everything; I'm the girl that set my dorm room on fire trying to make a poptart for dinner, and since him, I bake cookies in stupid little heart shapes, and fantasize about cleaning our future toilets together.  You have to understand-- this guy does things like, builds his own telescope and computer, develops his own programming language, and pedantically corrects my grammar in emails. I was powerless, really :-) With every crumpled up piece of paper with calculations on it, that I find in his room, I fall harder and harder, for him :)\n\n\nThere are odd coincidences; our families were both from the same small Italian town, and we were both visiting for a summer festival (and I mean small, as in, no stores and only a truck that brings your bread and milk, kind of small). In Canada, we lived about 25 minutes apart, and even went to the same University, with some overlap. We belonged to the same Italian-Canadian club, without ever crossing paths, and of course, due to small town syndrome, our families knew each other. I would go on to discover years later, that he's off to the side in many of my pictures from Italian club events, and pictures of him as a child, are even in old calendars we had, that said Italian town created for charity. Most impressive to a reddit audience, perhaps, is the fact that I actually followed him online for years-- I had bookmarked pages of his threads, and I loved his rants and witticisms, from slashdot and beyond. Upon discussion, we came to realize that this was his username, and that I had even sent a few fangirl emails over the years to him (realizing from some of his references in posts, that we were from the same area of Canada), which of course he promptly ignored. I had even read-- and loved-- his sci-fi fanfic, on various pages that we both frequented. When he tore into someone online, he tickled my ovaries with his brilliance!\n\n\nYou know, he hates Starbucks (we all have our flaws, heh!),  my driving, makes fun of me for watching the Hills, doesn't want the 10 dogs that I do, thinks seeing the Nutcracker once in your lifetime is sufficient, and he'd probably hate this post (and correct the grammar!).  And, for the first time ever with someone, that's all okay :-)   He fixes my computer, brings me sushi with extra wasabi, and downloads missed Family Guy episodes for me; that's worth more than any amount of flowers or Tiffany's, in the world.  \n\n\nI still (honestly) find it hard to read the things he writes online, without melting, or to stare into his hazel eyes with those crazy long eyelashes, without having some 16 year old girl response, like, \"awww....I luv my boyfriend\"!  I still wake up every single morning, after almost six years of knowing him, unable to come up with a reason not to like him as much as I do. I can barely remember a time, when I didn't feel this way about him, and even after all this time, I still quiver when he smiles at me. I honestly want to put the cereal in his milk in the morning, for the rest of my life. Regardless of what happens 20 years from now, though, I will forever be grateful, to *Italy*, and to that small town with the milk truck. Viva L'Italia!","c0gjjyc":"Nice.

Granted it may be difficult to find servers for PC game mods such as Point of Existence, which despite being fun games have like no Australian servers.\r\n\r\nHis second reason is laughable at best, 'omg I don't have time', he calls himself a video game critic then says he doesn't have time to play games.\r\n\r\nAnd I can tell he hasn't played MW2 multiplayer, that game is made in such a wierd way that even a shitty fps player such as myself can at least manage a 1:1 kill\/death ratio in most matches, worst ratio I've ever had is a 2:1 kill\/death, which still makes it quite enjoyable. Of course whether or not this is even true has nothing to do with it, he should still be giving the multiplayer portion of games a fair go the same way he gives the SP part a fair go (or not as he has claimed not to have finished games he's criticizing).\r\n\r\nOf course his third point about ther being nothing more to see is ridiculous too, go figure, a guy who admits to have never really given multiplayer a fair chance claims multiplayer has nothing 'new to see'. He talks of the subject like he's experienced while at the same time basically admitting he has no idea.\r\n\r\nHe's right that the singleplayer of any game should probably 'stand for itself', that doesn't mean the multiplayer can't stand for itself too, just because a game has a singleplayer does not mean it can't be more enjoyable if it had a decent online.\r\n\r\nAnd finally point 5, sure, people are shit, and I hear stories about how horrible xbox live is, but seriously, there MUST be a mute button for people you don't like? I play on the PC where 99% of people aren't dicks, or maybe being a dick is just an American thing (I play on Australian servers)?

Or if they're better they'll do the grenade shoving but hey guess what: It's a game, and at least unlike face to face games I have the option of not needing to know about what an asshole the guy I'm playing against is.\r\n\r\nOK lame, I didn't mean to rant, now I feel like one of those asses who does nothing but stays home and borwses reddit all day.","c0gkeze":"I don't get it.

Atleast these days they have the ability to patch these glitches, back in the day they had to issue entire new cartridges if there was a game breaking glitch. The fact is that when you sign up for xboxlive, you sign a EULA that says you will not exploit game mechanics to create unintended results. Nobody can possibly argue that it was meant to be this way. Also, especially in multiplayer games, there are assholes who beta test these games, some of them even are paid for it and when they find glitches like this they do not report them and instead wait for the official release and then start using them to get the edge. This caused the MMO Age of Conan to suffer a game breaking glitch on release day that caused the game to not have a bank, mailbox, or auction house for over a month becuase a couple of people found a duping glitch and kept it a secret until the game launched.

It's so topical and annoying, I feel like everyone who uses it is just posing and strutting around for others, except it's on the internet and through photos, retarded fan pages, wall posts and DISLIKE HURR kind of stuff that really, really irritates me.\n\nIt has something to do with what I am seeing as the increasing connectivity of our society and the possibility that we may be a little to connected.  We can use our cell phones to update our status and upload pictures taken three seconds ago, we can get instantaneous reviews of a restaurant, its phone number, whether any of our facebook friends have liked it or if anybody on twitter posted something about it, using facebook through twitter on your xbox 360... it's a sensory overload, too much  information that clogs the brain and maybe makes us *less* connected than we were previously.  It all feels more than a bit Orwellian, like the scenes with the retinal scanners in Minority Report or something.  What is the future, brainwave links coupled with over-the-eye HUDs and instant updates from various websites fed to our brains through whatever?  \n\nWe invest so much time and effort into cultivating our personalities through intangible and inhuman things and maybe I'm just being a bitch about it, but something about it just seems weird and unappealing.","c0godk1":"Reminded everyone of that xbox ad.\n\n\/Edit.

But the first two letters of my names spell out Ke, Mi, Kl, and that's my gamertag, so I get called chemical on xbox live, which I think is pretty cool.","c0gpyr6":"The game itself is the same on both systems. Though the PS3 has more power, or whether you believe the XBOX does, it is irrelevant to most multiplatform releases. \n\nGenerally, only exclusive titles make the most out of the system. Multiplatforms are mostly the same, though likely some negligible differences do occur. In MW2's case, it would probably favor the xbox, because IW favors the xbox, and it's been known that the PS3 has annoyed the shit out of game developers.\n\nThose tiny differences (if any) aside, psn is free, xbox isn't. Most everybody on xbox has a headset, not so for psn (which I consider a good thing on psn's part). You may not have to buy DLC on the xbox if you have these gamerpoints, but you will for the psn (though, you'll likely break even with the cost xbox live incurs).","c0gpz2c":"PS3, why? The online is free, graphics are actually a bit better, you get a blu-Ray player, and because when xbox lowered their price you got less stuff, when Sony lowered the price the price just got lower.

My problems are a bit advanced but I can offer some advice after much searching on the subject.\n\nWhen you go to start a multiplayer lobby it will state your NAT type if you are behind a normal residential router (most all use NAT as far as I know).  \"Strict\" is bad.  \"Moderate\" is do-able.  \"Open\" is preferred.  The best trick is to make sure the correct ports are open.\n\nStart your xbox.  Goto system settings and look at your network configuration (I'm paraphrasing here - find it in the menus) and find your MAC address.  Use this MAC address to create a static IP reservation in your router.  This will ensure that everytime you turn on your xbox, you will get the same IP.\n  \nMake sure you have the correct ports open.  Go into the Port Forwarding menu in your router and assign the following ports to the IP you created a reservation for.  Correct ports are (via [http:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/kb\/908874](http:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/kb\/908874):\n\n* TCP 80\n* UDP 88\n* UDP 3074\n* TCP 3074\n* UDP 53\n* TCP 53\n\nThis should make your multiplayer experience better, especially if you see \"Strict\" when you go to start a lobby now, and \"Open\" after you make the changes.  \n\n******************** \n\nI have 2 xbox's at my house (since my roomate and I both play) behind a NAT.  Initially we had a terrible experience in multiplayer.  When my roommate and I tryed to play with other friends online in groups of 5 or more we had issues finding games, joining games and staying in games once joined.  We would also constantly get kicked out of our xbox live party (for the chat).\n\nOnce we passed around the correct ports and everyone got their crap configured correctly most of the problems went away.  I mean, we still have trouble finding and joining and staying in games...  just not as many problems.","c0gq8i1":"Why the fuck does this link to the xbox360 subreddit?

But I don't think MW2's multiplayer was a wise choice to start learning how to use the controller, not if you care about stats or winning, anyway. My first experience with dual analog sticks was a little over 2 years ago when I bought an xbox just so I could play Bioshock. I must of spent the first half of that game running around staring at the floor and then wildly sweeping across the screen when I had to shoot anything but by the end I was getting the hang of it. Fast forward to today and I'm pretty much a beast with the thumbsticks, surpassing even my friends who had been playing xbox since halo 1 days. In fact, I helped some of them get 50s in Halo 3 in Doubles and Team Snipers. When I'm playing games I don't even realize that I have a controller on my hands anymore, my eyes just spot people and my thumbs automatically do what I need them to. Sorry for ranting on.\n\nTL;DR **Practice.** It's the only way you get better and improve your accuracy.","c0grb5x":"If the Zune HD is any indication, Microsoft is quite capable of doing portable devices. They just need incentive, and the xbox\/media center folks on the job.","c0grcka":"First, read [this](http:\/\/features.teamxbox.com\/xbox\/1607\/Xbox-360-VSync-Issues-Demystified\/p1) but the takeaway is the following quote.\n\n&gt;However, having said that, the vast majority of games choose to run at a constant 30 or 60fps.\n\nIf you buy a 120hz or 240hz tv when most of the games are hitting 30 or 60fps then the tv will be refreshing more than needed.  This isn't bad for future stuff, but its not needed for current gen consoles.\n\nThe 120hz technology is like hyper-interlacing where it \"creates\" extra frames by smoothing the differences between the previous and next frame.  This is also likely what they reference by \"120hz technology\" so that people can understand this \"magical\" motion enhancing technology.  The actual monitor refresh is probably actually 240hz.\n\nMy take on it is this:  get the best 60hz tv you can get, or get a decent 120hz on sale, or bone yourself all over with a 240hz tv.  \n\nI bought a very basic LCD tv 4 years ago (wow, has it been that long) and paid $1800 for it.  Now it gets absolutely destroyed by $450 tvs.  When it comes time to have consoles that *need* 120hz or 240hz you'll be able to afford them and it isn't like they'll skip backwards compatibility.  Or actually, they probably will still have them vblanked to 30 or 60, just like always.\n\nAlso, consider [this](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frame_rate#How_many_frames_per_second_can_the_human_eye_see.3F).  The biggest draw for 120hz is for very fast action or for people who notice it the most.  Otherwise it'll just help you on jagged edges if you just *happen* to catch them.  \n\nHow many times have *you* noticed motion blocks on your tv?","c0grdar":"All that potential, gone to waste.\r\n\r\nHere, have this:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.llamma.com\/xbox360\/repair\/ring_of_light_x-clamp_fix.htm\r\n","c0grdni":"Wake up.\nEat unhealthy breakfast.\nLook for a job,fail at that.\nTurn on xbox and computer.\nFap.\nPlay on MW2 on my xbox.\nEat some more.\nFap.\nPlay xbox again.\nComplain about my life.\nGo to sleep.\n\nDo the same thing next day.","c0grf9r":"Sorry dude I got it for xbox so I can play with friends, but I might get it for PC as well.

Anything moving, like a person walking, looks like it's floating because of their interpolation algorithm. Video games also look weird and sort of blurry at 240hz again due to their interpolation algorithm. It didn't look all that great, and I was disappointed. We turn it back to 60hz to play xbox.","c0gruye":"orange box, xbox 360.

I'll get 4-6 hit markers and then die.  The killcam shows me barely turning in time to get a shot off.\n\nI know my problem.  It's that I live in NC but I play with friends from Canada and Wisconsin. I read they are going to implement a \"force local\" option which should provide an experience similar to a dedicated server.

Boy than just supermanning hos. For one, the kid had, like, 20,000 fans before he even got a record deal, probably before anyone working at a record label had heard of him. He knows how to work the internet. In this way he is a shining example of what the so-called \"techno-natives\" are capable of. Just think of him moving up from clowning around in school, to making his jokes into songs, to making his stupid, jokey, inappropriate songs into a phenomenon. He achieved world fame this way.  \n\"Crank Dat\" was one of those joke songs, but his other work delves a little further into the lifestyle of the young, nouveau-riche, and famous. The only other good song on Souljaboytellem.com (and I will admit that there's only one really good song on each Soulja Boy record), \"[Yahhh!](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UfCmYyG-yg4)\", shows us how committed Soulja Boy is to only caring about himself, his friends, and his career. His response to everything else in the world is a primal roar.  \nA line from \"Turn My Swag On\" goes, \"Since I was nine years old, I got it in my head, I'm'a die for this gold,\" only to be interrupted by the soundbyte \"Soulja Boy tell 'em!\" (used as background noise in most of his songs). The rest of the song explains how S. Boy and his friends all wear the best sports jerseys and spend their time lounging around his awesome mansion. This is the living autobiography of a young goofball turned famous. \n\n&gt;I'm gonna guess that you've never read Soulja Boy's twitter. It is probably the only thing on the whole website worth reading. The way this boy communicates with his fanbase... well, I think he's the only one who really knows how to use twitter. One time, and it was only up for a few minutes, he wrote a series of twitter posts, giving an even deeper, rawer look at how he deals with fame. Luckily (i guess), I was reading the aforementioned twitter at the time and was able to save this text, now lost to the public:\n\n&gt;&gt;Shit ain\u2019t how it use to be.

If your really fans and love and support me\nYou would hear me out and help ya boy get thru this shit..  \n\n&gt;If you didn't know, Soulja Boy spends almost all of his time on twitter or on live webcam with his fans. If he's not doing that (or doing a concert), he's on xbox live (and he'll play whomever challenges him in any game). I guess to tell the whole truth, I don't like the majority of his music. It's very amateur, and not very pleasant aside from the songs I mentioned here. He's certainly a stupendous entertainer, though, and a very interesting character.\n\n&gt;\"I got a question: Why they hatin' on me?\"  \n--DeAndre Way\n\n&gt;edit: wow, I just realized I wrote a whole lot about Soulja Boy just now.

I forgot to add, this thought stems from the fact that most piracy happens in third world countries, like... uhm, lets say [Brazil](http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2009\/11\/21\/playstation-2-finally-launches-in-brazil-for-the-bargain-price-o\/), as opposed to our other neighbor Colombia, where recently released games can be purchased at your local super-market for as little as the price of two gas tank refills.","c0gtfuz":"I liked Morrowind more but the loading times on the xbox version were soooo long...","c0gtghr":"sorry downvoters, only pineapples allowed here. \n\nedit:  any of you wanna get teabagged by a badger?

Oh, and Oblivion's fast travel - way better.  I had morrowind on the xbox.

Adventure, stealth, 3rd person shooter, slower FPS games-- controller.\n\nPart of the complaint is that devs continue to put PC-style shooters on the console. The low FOV, lack of precision, and slow turn rate of MW2 on the console makes me feel like I'm playing drunk, whereas on the PC I can place the cursor accurately and quickly.

It seems like the swede just jumped into a game with all noobs and set loose some maximum fury. \n\nThe difference between this game and BF2 is that in BF2 you need a squad of people working in tandem to take down a chopper or a tank: or be ridiculously talented. In MW2, if you want to drop someone's vehicle out of the sky, all it takes is a kit with the cold-blooded perk (you don't show up as a target to air support), a stinger missile launcher, and sleight of hand (fast reloading) in case your first missile doesn't get the job done. \n\nThen again, this guy was playing the xbox version of the game. It's no wonder that nobody was smart enough to shoot down his shit.","c0gubos":"Because I'm not good at the game and immediately went 15-3 with them, and everyone else I know had a similar experience. I'm sorry, but it's true: **the 1887s are the easiest and least-fair weapon in the game**. The defense that the people who don't like them are just \"not good enough to use them\" is *incredibly* weak; the assumption is that people have tried the weapons and rejected them for not getting a good score, which is just not true. Most people reject them for other reasons entirely.\n\nAll of my friends and I have the 1887s, some with Akimbo unlocked, and none use them, even though they'd increase our score. It's not out of any particular conviction, just that none of us like playing a weapon that's just blatantly out of the normal range of weapon performance. In fact, the only circumstance I've seen my friends use the akimbo shotguns is by stealing an enemy's to grief them. You see, a few of the people I play with *are* good, and when someone kills them with the akimbo 1887s, they tend to go 10-0 *on that person.*\n\nI'm not someone who advocates not playing the 1887s because they're unfair; I just choose not to. I do advocate a serious range reduction in the next patch so that it's not unequivocally the best loadout in the game. MW2 simply isn't worth playing for me when there's one gun that's so vastly superior to the others, and clearly many other people feel the same way. I didn't buy a game to deal with sprinting assholes with 2 shotguns who have to gesture in my general direction to kill me; I bought it as a reasonably realistic \"arcade tactical\" shooter. Javelin glitch + knifing class + akimbo 1887s just ruins that for me. I'll still play it once in a while, but until they fix the bullshit, it's lost the love.\n\nEDIT In response to your edit: I didn't say that I wasn't beating them, just that I didn't enjoy the environment. Finding a counter isn't hard; I just don't enjoy an environment in which everyone runs around knifing or shotgunning. An RPD puts those bastards to sleep as quick as ever. I can still stick a 1:1 KDR against them, but the deaths are all infuriating. As for the running wild, I can't speak to it-- I played CoD4 on the PC, where I WAS legitimately good (now I'm not so good on the xbox), and I played with all kinds of weapons. One loadout was the shotgun, but since it was awful in CoD4 it wasn't as infuriating-- it was a reflex class rather than an aim class. Probably my favorite gun was the MP5 with the RPD in second.","c0gubxh":"first i shroomed.  next i haloed.  then i got blown the fuck up by a plasma.  saw this crazy pose.  voila.\n\ntools:\nphotoshop, lightroom, google, xbox","c0guht0":"In a 200 person lecture last year, there was a kid who played COD 4 on his computer with an xbox remote under his desk every class.\n\nCollege is awesome.","c0gujqv":"I don't classify games as good or bad, I only see games as games that I enjoy playing and games that I don't enjoy playing. \r\n\r\nI got EDF2017, it was super fun for about 2-4 hours, then I took it out of my xbox and never put it back in.","c0gujza":"I was about to ask the same question.

There is no short answer to this, basically a sum of all kinds of things. I was doing this as part of a group, and we were trying to figure out this one common code block that kept cropping up in a lot of StarForce-protected files and kept seeming like gibberish. After a bit of discussion and comparing some notes, it turns out that StarForce *hijacks int01h, then hangs a miniature virtual machine off of it, code is then uploaded to it along with register states and stack variables, it is decoded and run on the virtual machine (which is sitting in ring0 this entire time, btw), then the updated register states and stack variables were sent back to the program in question. It was horrific, and figuring out how this bloody thing worked was basically a 5-day long Dexedrine binge. And that was just the tip of the iceberg. On top of that, this thing had an extremely joyous VFS-hooking driver that hid certain files from view from applications that used the standard Win32API calls to read directories\/files. Yes, like the infamous Sony rootkit that hid any file beginning with $sys$. Yes, StarForce did this FIRST.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the actual linking of the protection system to the game. The dll is packed, and unpacks many of its subroutines on-demand. Virtually always StarForce-protected games do some form of IAT-protection, so subroutines that only use vm-opcodes are not actually pointed to in the IAT. Thankfully, the exit point of the VM is trackable fairly easily, otherwise Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory might have survived even longer without being cracked.\r\n\r\nA bunch of technical documentation on this pesky app is available here: http:\/\/www.glop.org\/files\/rld-sfrt.rar\r\nI'd basically consider it one of the most advanced rootkits I've ever run into. Oh, another cool feature that the VM had was to prevent itsself from being detected or from interfering with normal debugging as much as possible, it hooks the kernel SwapContext routine, so that if a non-StarForce-protected process called int01h, it would actually attempt to pass control to whatever was previously located at int01h and try to actually keep two sets of debug regs around, one for SF-protected programs and one for everything else. In practise, this often broke and sometimes even caused wonderful wonderful STOP errors, but it was actually extremely clever, and did keep a lot of people from finding that bloody virtual machine for an extremely long time.\r\n\r\n#2) Depends on the game. You literally would be shocked as to how many things can be cracked simply by NOPing out a branch or changing a conditional JMP to an unconditional JMP (really the same technique, just depends on which branch goes where :P), but some people try harder. Polymorphic code is extremely rare outside of genuine viruses and rootkits, though. Things like SecuROM and StarForce do, however, try to be a pain in the ass. Rootkit-esque protections are starting to become more common among some developers. It really depends.\r\n\r\n#3) imho, the best form of copy-protection, i.e. the only one that WORKS, is the one that Steam and Blizzard have implemented: online validation of the cdkey before they'll let you play multiplayer via the official servers (or in the case of Steam, multiplayer at all). There is no way around this short of hacking the auth servers themselves, and it comes with the benefit that you can even grab the game for free with no local protection at all, and few people will do this without paying for a subscription, because who wants to play against the Warcraft III AI all day long?\r\n\r\nOther than that, any software-based form of copy protection, just like any form of DRM is doomed to failure. It is simply impossible from a cryptographic\/mathematical perspective: you are given the ciphertext (encrypted program, encrypted music, w\/e), and the decryption key, and for some reason someone wants you to not be able to find the cleartext (direct x86 asm commands, direct PCM wav samples @ 44.1Khz\/16bit, whatever). The only thing that you could do is make it take longer to crack by being extremely complicated and convoluted, but it *will* get cracked. There is no way around this. Trust me on this. I wish the game manufacturers would, and just give up already. It is fighting a losing battle, and the only people getting hurt by it are those who legitimately bought the game, more often than not.\r\n\r\n#4) It's unnerving, but surprisingly enough most of its uses in actual software so far have been for hardware encryption or hardware-based random number generation, i.e. cryptographic purposes, which are actually a good thing, really. I can't say much about what it would imply for cracking things if various DRM apps started using this technology en-masse as I haven't looked into it too much myself, but it could be anything from disaster to a mild annoyance. And given how these things tend to work, it will almost certainly be the latter. Flaws will always be found. See, for instance the generation 1 xbox and the absolutely ludicrous amount of bugs, some of them ridiculously obscure and complex (so did you know that all computers sold today still actually support Gate A20? Yes, I'm serious. That wonderful pain in the ass from past still exists, despite approximately three people in the world actually still using it on hardware more recent than an 80386).\r\n\r\n#5) SIce, Olly, IDA Pro, whatever works, really. Olly is, however, really popular because it's free, works extremely well, and has a shitton of useful plugins written for it. Seriously, it's one of the best pieces of software I've ever seen or used, and one of very few that I actually would pay money for.","c0gvmx3":"I've gone through so many xbox controllers.

So that picture inside the black box is all that shows up on my screen, not the black borders around it.\r\n\r\nOn this other TV when the screen is set to 1920x1080 there's a large gap of black all around the TV, which techinically should only happen if the screen is actually showing a larger resolution than 1080. Actually going to be easier if I take pictures of this. \r\n\r\n[Here](http:\/\/imgur.com\/FFtM6)\r\n\r\nWe were able to fill it a bit better by playing with settings on the TV itself, but there's a section of blank screen, the yellow lines are the border of the LCD itself which are filled to when using it for anything else. Also note the first pics are of a different computer\/TV.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I was going about it wrong because on mine (screen shot in the OP) it's too big and needs to be scaled down, which is what happened in that first SS, where as this is the opposite in that the image is only being displayed on part of the screen, and I don't think that software will push it beyond that border.","c0h063p":"Sept. 27, 2009, my xbox displays the red ring of death.

Port forwarding does this, or you can setup a DMZ which I think is the easiest.\n\nIf you don't want to deal with all of this, one of you could also just try connecting your xbox directly to the modem and using the public IP.  Most connections only give you one public IP, but it's up to your ISP.","c0h5g6i":"Break his xbox and admit you did did it.  Have him chase you around the house and out the front door.  His wrath with be sufficient to endure chasing you to the nearest park; wherein which you two will reconcile and then proceed to take a bird watching hike.","c0h5g6y":"so, how many times have you had to replace your xbox now? twice, three times?\n \nTrue, it would be completely dumb to buy any console for a single game (and possible perks that console offers (blu-ray,etc)). But you kind of sound stubborn about it. It's not that big a loss then to lose out on playing a single game that you can play at you friends house anyway.","c0h5h1i":"As a person that suffers from depression, I agree with your statement. BUT... There is nothing wrong with video games! If anything, weed is the problem! I go to a good university, straight A's, involved on campus blah blah blah blah, and I smoke weed EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. My friends, who also smoke weed every single day, are unable to do this, and do very poorly in the community college classes they are enrolled in. Some people can do work on weed, others cannot. \n\nI guess what my point is here is that you should worry about weed before you worry about video games. Trying to get him to quit both at the same time would be difficult, and allowing him to return to the familiarity of the xbox rather than the familiarity of the weed could be more beneficial.\n\nON THE OTHER HAND...you could reward him with weed for doing activities outside of the house.Go rock climbing rock climbing... so you can smoke weed on the top of a cliff. Let's go get baked and work out for an hour! The problem with this approach is that if you offer a reward for something he should feel good about doing on his own, you may kill the intrinsic reward he gets for a job well done.\n\ntl;dr: Weed can make you lazy. Try to get him off of weed before you do anything else.","c0h5ii2":"I thought I was the onlyone that didn't like .mkvs. It sucks that it's the one video format that the xbox won't play.","c0h5ivs":"Sacred 2 is awesome.

If you start trying to implant him into your social life then you're probably going to cause him to pull back because nobody likes to feel like they're a charity case or something. \nAlso, could you give a little more info about you? Just basic stuff I guess, like age and job or whatever. If you have kids and stuff, then staying up playing games with him maybe isn't an option, but if not, maybe you have the time to chill with him some of the time. Make his time with you fun enough that he'll decide that he has to change some habits to make time for you.\nI'm seeing a lot of good stuff about outdoor stuff, but also remember that the value of those things depends on both the activity itself and who you do it with. If you just up and drag him there, he might feel better than if the idea to do outdoor stuff grew organically out of your interactions.","c0h5jvn":"If you are satisfied at 19 by sitting around playing xbox all day long, with no friends, no high school diploma, and seemingly no productive future ahead of you - then you have a problem.

From what you're describing (lack of interest in things he used to enjoy, lack of goals and motivation) he may be suffering from clinical depression. Depression is chemical, and these chemical imbalances are influenced by behavior. To defeat it requires behavioral changes. Medication can be a big help, but there are no magic pills. Anti-depressants are like crutches for a broken leg. They shouldn't be permanent, but it's hard to get around without them while you're healing. Can you tell I speak from experience?\n\n2. Encourage him to improve his social skills by always inviting him out to do things. Don't pressure him too much, but always encourage him to come. \n\n3. Find out what he's good at and encourage him (again, gently) to pursue it. Maybe you could do it with him for a while.\n\n4. Help him find a job. Help him make a resume and find contacts for him. \n\nThese suggestions may help, but you may also need to dish out some tough love. Where does he live? With the parents? If so, get them on your side. Tell him he has to start paying rent\/paying for food\/etc. \n\nGive him a deadline and stick to it. Sell the xbox and games if he can't pay the rent, and set a new deadline. If he blows that, take the weed. Then take away the food (gradually). That will light a fire under his ass to go out and earn some money. Once he starts job-hunting, he'll realize that he can only get shitty jobs without a degree. After he's worked a shitty job for a while, he'll be begging to finish up his math. Again, I speak from experience. :)","c0h5li9":"Whoa...\r\nMy grandfather who served in WW2 was disappointed by the fact that the military, navy etc are allowed to recruit during school hours while colleges and universities required scheduled visits.

I highly encourage people to read it.  The examples they use that are against the R18+ rating are for all media, instead of computer games or easily apply to all forms of media.  \n\n* The aggression study was quoted as violent media.  \n\n* The problems for indigenous communities was a high access rate to porn.  \n\n* The other two arguments (problems with restrictions and exposure) apply equally well to DVDs.  Because, well, all current generation video game platforms support some sort of disk or cartridge that can be transported in the exact same fashion and obtained in the same manner (usually from the same stores) as movie disks.      \n\nSo all of the real arguments that may actually apply to video games apply to movies as well.  So Australia should harmonize their movie and video game rulings for consistency sake.  Either ban R18 movies or allow R18 games anything else is hypocritical. \n\nThe last argument is just \"I'm not listening la la la la\".  There are lots of reasons to change the existing restrictions.  \n\n* large development houses have a disincentive on setting up shop in Australia because they can't use resource to produce the full spectrum of games.  Video game houses and Movie shops tend to have a fair talent overlap.  So they are hurting their movie industry as well.\n\n* Legislative inconstancy causes confusion and increases the chance that people break the law by importing restricted material. This is a problem for the AG's office when they have already said something along the lines of Abos and immigrants are too stupid to use the rating system in their official PDF.  (Is the racism that bad in Australia that they assume stupidity over cultural differences on official government documents?)\n\n* Lack of ability to compete for Australian based digital download or online stores.

Certain verbal patterns I can say 100% fine without stuttering; others I have a tendency of stuttering on. Certain words I will almost always stutter on (seven, government) unless I use certain techniques to ensure they come out properly (*pause* s(exhale)even, the-government). Emotion seems to affect my stuttering but not in a predictable way. I don't seem to stutter when angry or sleepy. I haven't analyzed this much.\n\n* I feel fine about it because I deal with it effectively enough that the vast majority of people I deal with don't know I stutter. People who have known me for a long time, people I converse with for extended periods of time, and people whom I am close with know that I stutter for various reasons. It usually becomes apparent to my teachers at some point. The only time it is downright obvious that I have a speech impediment is when I am reading an extended passage out loud. I've been with 4 girls officially in the past. I am very very outgoing and sarcastic...my personality hardly fits the disorder.\n\n* I am constantly thinking of new ways of working around it. I will often have other people make phone calls or order food at a drive through for me. It's easiest to deal with face to face. It's basically a matter of quickly choosing an alternate word in mid-sentence, repeatedly. Luckily, I am well-read.\n\n* This is the most interesting part. I don't stutter alone, except on the worst words I mentioned in the first question. I never stutter while whispering, ever. Singing or rapping is almost always stutter-free, until I reach a particularly difficult linguistic segment. Talking on the phone, drive thru, etc. makes it noticeably worse.

Does that sound about right?\n\nYes, that sounds right.\n\n\"Be literal\" is the short form of the advice, but it's actually a bit more complicated than that. Aspies will occasionally use metaphors, figures of speeches, and so on. They are capable of learning that the sentence \"when pigs fly\" refers to the concept of never, just as they are capable of learning that the word \"dog\" refers to the concept of a dog.\n\nTo me, \"inference\" has a specific meaning, so I wouldn't say \"no inferences allowed\", but I would agree with \"don't expect aspies to infer\". The bigger issue is to avoid ambiguity. If you say \"when pigs fly\", how do I know whether you mean \"never\" or you mean \"when pigs fly\"? One possibility is that NTs and aspies have different ideas of what are appropriate \"cut-off levels of implausibility\" before dismissing an idea outright. If someone uttered the sentence \"We will use swine for aerial reconnaissance missions when pigs fly\", then it seems plausible to me that the person speaking this sentence that they may indeed intend the literal interpretation of \"when pigs fly\". I don't know if an NT would also entertain this literal interpretation, or assume the speaker meant \"never\".\n\n**Anecdote 1**: My mom asked me whether waving a magnet near a harddrive would cause the data on there to be unrecoverable. Although this was phrased as a \"yes-or-no\" question, I felt neither \"yes\" nor \"no\" was an appropriate answer. By asking me a question, I am inferring that my mother wishes to acquire some information from me. I could see two pieces of information that may be desired, and I was open to the possibility that there may be other possibilities that I had not even seen (since NTs are always so weird).\n\nOne possibility is that she wanted to know \"I'm interested in waving magnets around my computer, but I don't want to lose any data. Can I wave the magnets around and not expect to lose any data?\" to which I would advise her \"Don't wave magnets around. It's too risky.\"\n\nAnother is: \"I want to securely destroy some data. Is waving magnets around a sufficiently secure method of destroying the data?\" to which I would advise her: \"No. Government agencies have the technology to recover data from harddrives that have had magnets waved around them.\"\n\nSo I explained all of this to her, and she got offended. From her explanation, it seems she thought I was being pompous, and\/or she did not appreciate that I was being overly cautious of never being wrong, covering my ass from every possibility (perhaps she saw this as some form of cowardice?). I tried to explain to her that it takes me more effort to give out this long explanation, than had I simply said \"yes\" or than had I simply said \"no\", and so my giving this long explanation is actually a sign that I care about her enough to be willing to put the effort to give her correct information.\n\nSince she seemed to persist in demanding a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer, I told her in order to obtain one, she would have to clarify which of the two scenarios described the situation in which she wanted more information, or, if there was a third scenario I had overlooked, to describe that scenario to me. She did not do this. Or perhaps she did, but in a way that I did not understand. From my perspective, she was just repeating the original question: \"If I wave a magnet in front of my harddrive, would that destroy the data?\" It was very frustrating for me, and I felt for her, but I don't see what I else could have done but to provide her all the relevant information I had so that you could infer the information she actually wanted.\n\nIt was years later, when we had a different argument, that I brought up this argument, and she finally revealed to me that she was interested in the first scenario, and that I should have somehow known that the second scenario was implausible. I pointed out to her that it's not implausible to me. She asked me if I seriously believed the FBI wanted my data. I said I did not believe this, but I also refuse to sell used laptops or my old harddrives on eBay, nor to \"throw them out\", for fear of someone finding my harddrive, and using some of the technology that the FBI have (this technology may be readily available to the public) to recover saved passwords, credit card information, and so on. She said that's not normal.\n\n**Anecdote 2**: [A girl is seen on video complaining about her boyfriend always ignoring her, and then smashing his xbox.](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/tb\/a7f7v) An NT friend of mine sides with the girl, because she thinks the guy must have done something really horrible to the girl to drive her to commit this act of violence.\n\nI condemn the girl, because we have video evidence of her committing the crime she is accused of (smashing the xbox), and from what she says, it seems that the smashing was intentionally done to cause harm to the guy (i.e. it was not an accident, or a misunderstanding, etc.).\n\nI don't condemn the guy because there is no evidence that the guy has done anything wrong. The girl claims that he ignored her, but I don't know if she is telling the truth about this matter or not. I would wait to hear the guy's side of the story before passing judgement.\n\nMy NT friend thinks it's implausible that a girl would do this for no reason. I claim that there's a lot of crazy people in the world, and lots of people do things for no discernible reason. I point out that we don't know if the boyfriend plays videogames at all, or, indeed, if the guy seen in the video is even her boyfriend at all. Again, my NT friend dismisses all of these possibilities as implausible.","c0h8y2g":"my apologies, they're not funny ones (it's 4 years since i thought of the game) but there is additional content from collecting\n\ncollecting the [memory vaults](http:\/\/psychonauts.wikia.com\/wiki\/Memory_Vaults) offer clues to each persons past.\n\nsorting out all of the emotional baggage in a person's mind will [unlock concept art](http:\/\/www.the-nextlevel.com\/review\/xbox\/psychonauts\/)\n\ntheres also a movie that plays when you get to level 100, and if i remember correctly that can only be done by collecting figments","c0h8yxr":"just because I choose not to play online doesn't mean i'm not having fun while playing my games.  i play with my roommates and friends i just choose not to play on xbox live.","c0h8ziu":"I didn't...didn't have an xbox for a long time and I was more of a mouse and keyboard kind of person anyways.\n\nI played multiplayer on Zone forever (from the beginning of MM1 to the end of MM2), and there's still 20 or so people over on 24krobbers.com that play MM2 every now and then....gamesmasta is on reddit too...","c0h90su":"maybe its because the xbox has 1000x more hardware to fail","c0h9130":"I like to think i make her feel appreciated.

It sucks that you got such a negative response. :(\n\nIn response to anecdote 2: I saw a video like this, but it was a girl smashing a PS3.

Where the pro gaming circuit is concerned, IW should have considered their design's implications.

The latest glitch has affected 4 out of every 5 of my xbox Live games.  This glitch isn't an \"oops\".  An \"oops\" is where a player gets outside the map or is able to blow themselves up with a weapon.  This glitch changes the entire dynamic of the game.  It's not an \"oops\", it's a fuck up. Maybe i missed it, but i was unable to find an official response from IW.\n\nCombine the original design flaws with the ongoing programming flaws, I see nothing more than incompetence.  Perhaps I'm just irked, but these issues have made me rethink my product loyalties.

My preference is the ps3, as I proudly take no part in the shitty XBL community with all the ignorantly fake shit talkers, the mainstream \"manly men\" exclusives and all the general bullshit hype behind all of it.\n\nAt least on the ps3, I can play online with TRUE gamers who actually relate to me, and understand the same points in gaming that I do, the points worth understanding, the valid aspects that make gaming great for those who truly know it.\n\nI've been gaming for over 2 decades, all of my life I have been gaming. I grew up playing japanese games, on japanese consoles, and the majority of the gaming culture has derived from these games and consoles, and is the TRUE consistent gaming culture which has persisted throughout all of the TRUE gamers childhoods up to this point.\n\nNOTE that I am not addressing the TRUE gamers on XBL, as I know you are there..you are just so vastly, VASTLY outweighed by faux gamers, that theres really no point, but the point is.. Xbox Live is the cancer to the once valid and refined gaming culture. Most xbots HATE japanese games, the very games that has molded the culture throughout the lives of TRUE gamers.\n\nMost XBL players only started playing games when it suddenly became socially acceptable, and not associated to losers, and dorks and outcasts, althrough I would gladly accept those titles if it meant it would keep all the frat boys and jocks and general unrefined morons out of my gaming community, which is the only thing I had when I was growing up.\n\nFuck the 360 community, I hope it fucking dies, I hope all these jocky faux gamers just fall out of this cultural fad and go somewhere else, and leave games alone, because they are vastly diluting the culture, and influencing game developers, while discouraging japanese games.\n\nFuck all you xbots.  Most of you are completely fucking retarded. Not because of the machine you play on, but because you literally don't have a fucking clue to what a real gamer is, or what a real GAME is for that matter.","c0hae3b":"hrmm, haven't played L4D2, but L4D had atrocious loading times on the xbox (even if installed to the HDD). L4D is not THAT old, so i'm going to call you out on that one, unless these restrictions you mention are new and\/or you can link to an official source stating they exist.\n\nThe real reason loading screens exist is two fold. Games are coming from generally slow optical media (at least in the case of the xbox, they have to develop the game assuming no one is installing the game to the hdd), and developers are generally lazy - albeit more games these days cut down on load times once you're in the game through the likes of geometry and texture streaming.","c0hafaw":"My buddy is quite happy about this.

Its frustrating to see the very people who grew up making fun of you suddenly infiltrating themselves into the hobby in which they used to use against you, then just rip it apart.  I am thankful for the online ps3 community, it seems thats all thats really left when it comes to the true gamers, and the true gamer culture which has always consisted up until the emergence of the xbox culture, which now seemingly represents all of gaming to the developers, and to everyone else in society who don't play games.\n","c0hafuq":"I've been on the XBL for about 3 years now and I don't have any problems with it.

They only play fps games, they hate on japanese games and oldschool games, and they are the majority in the grand scheme of things.  It is the same everywhere.

I have a 360 because it was given to me, and i have a 360 to play games alone. I do have a live account, but I don't use it much anymore. Why? because of the types of gamers XBL attracts. The player that thinks Halo is gods gift to gamers, fuck those people and fuck the Halo community. The Halo community is the micro-version of the entire community, it is all like that, in every game that I've attempted to play on XBL.\n\nAt heart I am a PC gamer. That is where I started, and that is where I am staying, it is worth the hardware, and building a new rig ever 2 to 4 years for me. I am going to disagree with you about the FPS titles,  and you may not like it. The FPS genre was started on the PC, and it is the best on the PC, anyone who says differently, well I challenge them to a round of TF2, they can use their controller and I will use a mouse and keyboard. I've also been gaming for two decades. I got my first nintendo when I was 4, and played a few hours a night. As soon as I got a PC I jumped head first into games like Doom, Quake, and similar titles. Don't lump the FPS titles from consoles in with a true FPS. Even great games like Kill Zone 2 are watered down in comparison to a PC FPS title. This goes for the 360, and the Sony. There are plenty of FPS titles that are represented very artistically, and driven with a wonderful story, or breathtaking graphics. Don't lump every FPS out with generic shit like Halo, or FEAR. Those games suck, and were made to appeal to your casual-wannabes. The gamers that are casual, but really, really wish they were hardcore.\n\nI love my PS3, but I don't play FPS games all that often on it, or on any console for that matter. The controls suck, plan and simple. I avoid games like Halo because the community is full of low-brow clones of one another. Every Halo game has a majority of players. Different names, but they all act exactly alike. They have spent plenty of time practicing their insults, but actually suck ass at the games. \n\nJapan has given a whole lot of culture to the gaming community, but don't leave out what the US contributed to the community. Especially in the ways of the PC, to leave that out almost entirely from your post is willfully ignoring a section of gaming that has helped shape the culture. Right now it may not be as prominent and powerful as it once was, but once all those faux gamers die off anything could happen. I am pissed that the Faux gamer community has essentially fucked up MW2. I am sure people are sick of hearing about this, but I played the first MW very seriously, and it pulled me away from CS: Source, which was fine. But then to turn around and cater to the casual gamer with a game that from the ground up plays like a serious shooter is insulting as a consumer, and a gamer. Yet, it's still made the most money this year. It is hardly the best game of the year, but it is going to earn that title because people mindlessly purchased that title. Why? Not because it's a good game, but because Infinity Ward and Activision knew how to advertise, and because the first Modern Warfare was awesome, and frankly a much better game then MW2 could ever hope to be.\n\nI do have some problems with the Sony community, they are closed off. I haven't met nearly as many friendly people on the Sony community as I have in the PC community. People are nice, they just aren't willing to talk, or get to know you, or even travel from game to game with you as much. The PC community has this, and by far the best community out of any gaming platform. I've met people in PC games, then turned around and added them to my Sony friends list so I could keep playing with them in different games. The PC community has graduated from the \"noob\" mentality for the most part. The years of heckling, and badgering other players for no real reason is quickly becoming moot, if not completely irrelevant. People on the Sony community don't act like twits, but they do act like your stereotypical anti-social gamer, someone who'd rather play with themselves then other people. That is the point of online gaming, that is what is supposed to make it fun. Meeting people, getting groups of friends together and then pitting them against each other in healthy competition.\n\nI have spent significant time in all of the online communities, and the PC community is the most developed, the most mature, and for me ultimately the most fun. Sony is second, but has quite a way to catch up, and XBL... Well... that is a cluster-fuck, but that's because that community is full of 15 year old zitty faced kids. This could easily change in another 5 to 10 years. I just don't want to wait that long for the xbox community to go through their awkward, stage of discovery and growth. I am an adult and I want an adult community now, not later.\n\n \n\n\n\n","c0hapag":"Oh wow, I had no idea. Are you sure it will continue if you start a new matchmaking session?

This subreddit has its share of blinder-wearing fanboys just like every other gaming community, but their presence here (probably in the minority) doesn't merit a post which generalizes all younger, xbox-playing gamers as a waste of human flesh and I think posts that give off this elitist vibe probably serve to galvanize the two sides more than anything else.  We shouldn't be doing that; not here on reddit.\r\n\r\nI think it's a serious travesty that a modern gamer has never heard of Hideo Kojima or Valve or Tim Shafer but I wouldn't hate him for it; he's just ignorant.

I have no problem with pc gamers, and I hold them in the same regard as I do myself, even if their emphesis is more of a western appeal, they still understand good games, and there are many great western developed games on the pc.  Thinking about it, It all started on the pc back in the 70s, and we wouldn't be where we are today if it had not.  \n\nI have a minor complaint with pc gamers though, now that I think about it.  A lot of them seem to feel they are vastly superior to console gamers.. I live in both worlds, but my main focus is consoles as I never grew up having access to a pc (until about the time I was a teenager) so all the time before that, I was playing on consoles, and is what I grew up on until I had a pc.

I unabashedly love it. I love action movies, and having such fond memories of watching The Rock with my dad back in 6th grade, being able to actually play through the underwater insertion and the shower room scene in the Gulag was like a childhood dream coming true. If you didn't get at least a few thrills out of the campaign I don't think you have a soul, or you're trying to be contrarian on purpose. Not to mention the soundtrack!\n\nThe multiplayer seems to be where most of the complaints are but I haven't had many issues with it. Reading some of the comments in here on other MW2 threads it seems like it's nonstop hacking, glitching, 300ms ping. But I really haven't had any more problems than I had with CoD4 on the xbox. The host migration, while annoying, works a lot of the time and it's a hell of a lot better than just dumping us back into the lobby. Hacking exists but I've really only run into a couple of really super obvious hackers, not enough to ruin my enjoyment. Lag is sometimes an issue, and for some reason occasionally a game will just be nonstop lag with no migration, but again that's really only happened once or twice.\n\nSometimes I'll rage when I get the drop on a guy, raise my sights up, and then he owns me with his dual 1887s, yes. But overall I do pretty well in terms of k:d ratio and sometimes I get what seem like pretty cheap kills on other guys so it balances out. I love the leveling, I love the tons and tons of unlocks, I love unlocking new titles and callsigns. I love how awesome the guns look and sound, and looking up to see a massive Pave Low hovering above the battlefield laying waste to the opposition. \n\nI think because of the dedicated servers debacle the game in general is taking an unjustified amount of shit. Would it be better with dedicated servers? Probably, although from what I've heard from CoD4 pc users dedicated servers bring problems like jerk admins banning everything they don't like from the server. Is it still a great game? Yes, I think so. I think the whole \"IW IS FUCKING THE PC GAMER\" attitude is unjustifiably coloring a lot of opinion on the game.

Listen, if I wanted to play like a dick, I wouldn't use the chat to spoil positions, I'd just throw on the akimbo 1887s-- which you, Infinity Ward, are completely okay with. I can understand not having party chat in S&amp;D and hardcore, but it's just actively making the experience worse. You know how we bootleg party chat?

Let me repeat that: **there is no universe, IW, *no conceivable plane of existence,* where you could justifiably define IWNet and the removal of dedicated servers as anything but an utter, complete failure, as evidenced by the shit-poor performance of your game on all 3 platforms.** Admit it, please, so we can move on.

Just find out the specs of the pc you already have, and then either post here, or on toms hardware forums to find out which cards will be compatible. The only things you need to worry about would be compatibility with the motherboard, and if your power supply is strong enough.\n\nIf you don't already have a pc, then yes, it probably will be a bit more expensive than a console, but not as much as some other posters have imlplied: usually when people buy a new pc they buy a new monitor, whereas when they buy a console they don't buy a new tv, and this makes up a huge chunk of the cost.\n\nIf money's no object, pick up a core i5, a gtx2**, and a whole bunch of RAM, and then you'll be able to play pretty much any game at full settings at high resolution.\n\nAlso, the PC has the most games. Consoles actually don't have very many 'exclusive' titles, they just shout more about it. Lot's of xbox games come out on PC as well, and there's quite a few ps3 games coming out in the future that will play on the PC as well, e.g DC Universe Online, and The Agency.\n\nIn fact, the number of console exclusives coming out in 2010 is fairly small; 13 out of 190 games (not counting wii games) cannot be played on a PC.

I belong to an adult online gaming community that is xbox-centric, so I have a full friends list\n- The controller. The 360 controller is perfect, imo.\n- Online experience. Sure, it costs $50\/year (or less if you shop around), but I think it's worth it.

I was also pleased to discover that I can make [skype](http:\/\/skype.com\/) calls from my psp.  [Interesting](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_downloadable_PSP_games).\n\nSpeaking of calls the one of first things I did with my ps3 was to have video chat with a psn friend living in Canada (I think the rooms handle 4-5 maybe 6 video feeds in the same room [edit: it is 6](http:\/\/blog.us.playstation.com\/2009\/01\/ps3-how-to-starting-a-video-chat\/)). If you have an old usb keyboard or camera lying around you can use that easily enough as usb is natively supported.   \n\nGot an old cellphone bluetooth headset in a drawer somewhere?  Just pair it with the PS3.  No need to buy additional peripherals.   Got media on another computer?  Stream it.  Want netflix? Sign up for it.   Need to download movies? PSN has at least 900 or more titles for [SD video](http:\/\/www.us.playstation.com\/psn\/store\/about\/MoviesTV) like dvd's.  Then several hundred more for HD titles.  TV shows are around a buck.  Anime is available too.\n\nGot friends kinda new to gaming? [LittleBigPlanet](http:\/\/www.littlebigplanet.com\/) goes well with my non gamer friends.

I've been going through the 30 Rock seasons lately, they have everything through season 3 - the show is currently airing season 4.\n\nYou should check out some of the interviews that Reed Hastings (CEO) has done over the last year.

Also, many times the tv gets left on after one of them finishes playing something on the xbox - \"turn it off via controller, bam, I'm outta here.\"","c0heocx":"I had to throw my very old TV that kept me so busy as a child\/teenager\/college student because of this noise. I have trouble watching my parents tv because I can't stand the high pitched noise. But now I have an awesome tv and upgraded to a ps3. I was informed there is a rule that you can't own an xbox or ps3 unless you have a large hdtv to play it on. ","c0hephd":"I have been looking for a RTS for xbox and there is little choice. The few out there are all scifi or wizard\/elf type stuff. I tried C&amp;C for xbox and it sucked. After a great deal of searching I finally found one that while not a pure RTS is turning out to be a very interesting game; Battlestations: Pacific a WW2 pacific theatre air\/naval game. I have put in a dozen hours or so of play and hardly scratched the surface. It has an RTS component (managing\/commanding units) but you can also step in to any unit and take over from AI. Imagine C&amp;C with the ability to be a pilot or tank commander as a FPS. Sadly there are few people on XBL to play this very unique game. A bonus is that it was a mere $20.","c0herqz":"For the record, I prefer to game on my PC, but I disagree with the premise that PC gaming is cheaper than console.\n\nI built a new computer (that would play games a the time at or close to max settings) and bought an xbox 360 at about the same time four years ago.  They were pretty close in price, considering the price of 360's at the time plus peripherials and upkeep costs of the 360.  \n\nI bought the rechargeable battery pack\/docking station set and have paid the $50 annual xbox live subscription fee.  I didn't buy the wireless adapter, as I just moved my wireless router to where the xbox is and plugged it in.  I didn't buy a second controller, since I only play multiplayer online.  I have saved money on games by re-selling old games on ebay for about 40% of what I paid new.  (The trick is to buy at release, finish the game, and re-sell while gamestop is still selling used games for only $5 below new prices).\n\nHowever, I've put in at least double my original cost of my PC in upgrades to keep up with games.  I had to have put in at least $300 in upgrades to try to get Warhammer Online alone to look right, and performance still sucked in larger scale PvP.  \n\nI just might be too picky about game visuals, but I just cannot play games on lowest settings.  I realize that xbox games graphics are pretty similar to low settings on the PC, but PC games on low settings, sitting that close to a high res monitor, just look terrible.  \n\nAny game I can play on my PC I will take over the 360.  Right now I'm playing TF2, L4D and WoW (although wintergrasp is nearly unplayable due to the amount of players) on my PC.  MW2, Borderlands, and Bioshock I have to play on the 360.\n\nMicrosoft says the 360 will be around 'till 2015 ([source](http:\/\/xbox360.ign.com\/articles\/991\/991485p1.html)).  I'll have to do some serious upgrades to my PC at least once or twice more before then.  Meanwhile my Xbox will just take more batteries ($15 a year from costco) and $50 a year for my live subscription.  Yeah, it might have hardware issues that need repairing, but that happens on the PC also, so I'm calling that one even.\n\nTLDR version: PCs are only cheaper if you want to limit yourself to only playing certain games and\/or play newer games on lowest settings.  Otherwise consoles are cheaper.\n","c0hev0w":"Try renting it. I'm generally pretty critical..\n\nThe best review I found for it was a 9\/10, but it seems like it was a paid review.\n\n&gt;I never stopped having fun with Brutal Legend from beginning to end. I laughed, I screamed, I became frustrated, sad, and happy too. The story in Brutal Legend is so well crafted that it will keep you wanting to play those story missions. ... This is one of the best games of the year and there is a reason it won awards at E3. The game is a blast to play, the story is very well written, the characters are voiced well, and the music is awesome.\n\nEh, hardly. [Most places](http:\/\/www.gamerankings.com\/xbox360\/943672-brutal-legend\/index.html) seem to be giving it a 7 or 8.","c0hevus":"[Here's a link to a thread on the XBOX forums](http:\/\/forums.xbox.com\/30433745\/ShowPost.aspx)\n\nI joined a room like this (someone had an automatic AC-130) left, and have only experienced it once since then.

You can also then connect other wireless xbox items using it (up to 8 at a time)","c0hfk7w":"Yeah, firmware updates gone bad necessitate full credit back or a new equivalent device.  \n\nThis just happened with my xbox360 a month ago during a mandatory update to use xbox live.  I sent in my bricked 360 that was in pristine condition which was barely used.  The one I got back thankfully covered  by their 3 red lights of death extended warranty was all scratched up and had some sort of schmegma all over it from their crappy cleaning job from whomever owned it last.  Thanks Microsoft!!!","c0hfn6k":"I have a PC, a playstation, and both my brother and several of my flat mates all have xbox 360's, which I play a lot.\n\nIt annoys me when people either dismiss the pc as a platform, or they act as if it is so much more expensive than a console, when in reality, unless they're browsing reddit on a netbook, they most likely have a pc capable of playing most new games, and it's not expensive to upgrade.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with consoles: they are a very easy, simple way to play games, and they make local multiplayer much easier. My only real problem is that the games they have are not varied enough (no flash games, less indie games, less foreign games etc. etc.) and cost too much (an extra \u00a310 I don't have)","c0hfqa1":"To me the point of being frugal is to afford stuff like this. I love my computers and my guitars, and I sacrificed in other areas to get them. As long as you are saving and on track financially, I don't see the problem with buying some gadgets. I have a few things that I always consider when buying gadgety\/instruments\/etc:\n\n1. How much is it really going to enrich your life? I am working on a two year old macbook, and I really wanted to get a new one. But I realized the only thing it would really provide for me is a slightly better screen, non integrated graphics, and aluminum. I discounted that as gadget lust and moved on. Conversely, I am working on building a home server to stream all my content around my house to drop cable. Initial setup is going to cost around $500 (building my own linux server which is going to stream to modded xboxen and running my own ethernet and all that) which is just slightly less than a pay for cable in a year. The first year, no savings. the second year I save $500. Assuming the setup makes it another year, another $500. The real beauty, though, is that I get to satisfy some gadget\/tinkerer's lust.\n2. I *always* go after the best deal. I'll look for components for the above setup on craigslist, slickdeals, etc. It'll be running Linux (free), XBMC (free), the xboxen probably won't cost more than $30-$40 each. Look for refurbs, combo deals and clearance, and make sure you get in that sweet spot of cash\/performance. Just like I won't ever buy a brand new card, my computers will probably never have the latest video card, either. Both are going to severely drop in price\/value in the first year, and for negligible gains.\n3. Make sure you have your other finances in order. Have an emergency fund and be actively saving. ","c0hfs2z":"My reddit name and xbox live name are the same. Send me an invite and hopefully we can play sometime.","c0hg4l2":"Um. If xbox comes out with some sort of \"Wii Fit\" category game, then you might be in luck. I cannot say that Wii Fit type games will get you fit, but it is better than sitting on the couch and moving your thumbs.","c0hg6ft":"Yes... it involves me tying your xbox to my car and driving around the neighborhood while you chase it...\n\n...three times a week.","c0hgf0f":"well.. also most of them KNOW why they went broke.. and it was more their fault than the peoples.. well.\nPeople are idiots.\npeople will always be idiots.\nCorps have people trained to understand the business they are in. They should have known better.\nI mean in a society where you can get someone to willingly put up their car as collaterial on a 200% apr loan.. you can get a lot of idiots to but \"too much house\" by offering them a free car, wide screen tv and xbox.. if they \"sign today\"\n\nand the biggest problem was those deriviatives.. allowing you to sell the same loan many times.. this multiplied the effects of each forclosure.\n","c0hgh8j":"Actually, I couldn't decide on \"xboxes\" or \"xboxs\" so I just went with \"xboxen\". Besides, I think it's funny to picture me herding them across the living room.\n\nI do sometimes use froogle, although I am more cautious with that since they just aggregate prices from other sites. If it's from a place I know, then certainly. If not I either research a bit or keep shopping.","c0hgiyu":"I normally switch the serial #s just in case.  A lot of people downvote me normally for saying to do this, but I feel if you bought a product like an xbox 360 thats prone to failure , why should you, the consumer get screwed when it breaks? \n\nI feel its fair to do on items that are prone to breaking","c0hgmbt":"i got heroes, dexter, lost, a ton of other tv shows \n\nNot much else.

I also wish you didn't need to have the nuke equipped to use it when you hit 25. There has been a handful of times that I could have gotten a nuke by chance but didn't have it equipped at the time.","c0hgzii":"true story, my first try at it was with my mom and dad and girlfriend.

And I am pretty set on meeting my one and only through xbox live.","c0hhn28":"why would the developers want to fragment the market more than necessary?  right now, any ps3 or xbox360 can play any game for that respective system.  why would a developer want to reduce that number?","c0hhq3v":"Ok, I want to join a clan for Lord of the Rings: Conquest on the xbox360, as I want to play to win.  How do I go about doing so?  ","c0hhqcj":"Buy an xbox 360 modern warfare 2 and an hd tv. you will not regret it","c0hhtih":"I've done it once to my parents and they just pretended they looked away. It was the biggest shock of my life even though it was only on for less than 2 seconds. I threw myself on the controller and press stop but they probably heard the orgasm.\r\n\r\nThe other few times was when my gf or friends came over. They were trying to use my xbox media center to play some films. It started loading thumbnails of my entire collection. Funny enough one of the really fit girl were really interested and want to see what sort of collection I had. I'm not into bukkake but she was curious about the name and opened it, so I got really shy and didn't want to show it to her :(\r\n\r\nBack in the days of kazaa I just download anything I can see. My friends found 1-2 clips of dog porn and till this day they still think I'm into beastiality (or however it is spelt, don't want to try google that).","c0hhuzw":"Buy a xbox  360 or ps3 \n\nthere aren't enough pc games nowadays to warrant a new videocard","c0hhwi6":"&gt; Then what's the difference for consoles? PC games are just as large (or even larger).\n\nBecause with innovation comes risk and with risk there comes potential for monetary loss.\n\nIn the PC\/handheld market there is more innovation because there is more competition. This is due the lower risk and potential cost of a mistake.\n\nIn the console market there are 3 big players, all 3 of which have made a babystep towards a downloadable game system after the success of Microsofts xbox. However sucess is probably a loaded term since the sale of full games is still uncharted ground.\n\nRemember how long it took for some 3rd party developers took to move to steam? If I recall correctly EA hasn't been releasing their games for much longer than a year on steam and as a european gamer I know a lot of their titles weren't released on UK steam until midsummer.\n\nSo it took 5+ years for, love it or hate it, the worlds largest game publisher to adopt steam. While I doubt it will take quite as long for them to adopt a system for console games, in all honesty there isn't one yet. Sure xbox has some full games for sale, but is it steam? With it's weekend sales? It's simple to browse layout? Not yet.\n\nI think we'll see a major push from the console makers towards distributing AAA titles on their consoles in the next generation, perhaps with valve playing the middlemen like netflix do for films. But will we see them abandon optical drives all together? Hell no, at least not on Sony and Microsofts side.","c0hhzbz":"Winamp works beautifully for audio. No codec issues at all.

Read all you can there, and then reconsider getting a mod chip.  Soft modding is pretty prominent now for running homebrew applications.","c0hi3su":"I also agree that exclusivity agreements are bad. It is frustrating as a PC gamer seeing games being developed 'console only' as a marketing ploy to get people to buy a specific peice of hardware. \r\n\r\nAllowing customer choice should always be encouraged. I want to choose what system (be that xbox, ps3, or a pc) I play a game on. \r\n\r\nIf a game is released exclusively on a single console system, does the cost offset of not having to port the game to other formats outweigh the profits they would be reaping by sales to PC gamers?\r\n\r\nAfter playing video games for the better part of 2 decades, I cannot say I've ever seen a game that I wanted to play so badly I'd buy a 200+ dollar console system for. Are they actually gaining large amounts of money from people scrambling to buy ps3's just to play Uncharted 2? Is that amount so high that it would reduce profit to release it for PC?\r\n\r\nThese are questions I wish to know.","c0hi6ng":"I am assuming you know better than to use it on xbox live.","c0hi8sc":"what about the all corners brownie pan.  a new cookbook?  he have modern warfare 2 yet?  the most recent batman game for xbox was also amazing.  maybe some lift tickets to a near by mountain?

If that is the case I would highly recommend looking for a retail gaming outlet that takes used games\/merchandise similar to GameStop in the U.S. Then tell them you would like In-Store credit instead of Cash.

How dare you! No, I'm just kidding, you're alright man. \n\nI'm still a little confused. Beside the ambiguity of what wiki considers \"average\", that claim suggests that people get into \"gaming\" seriously at age 23... when the average person has been out of college for two years and should be working in a profession. \n\nBut this claim suggests that they've spent a third of their lives, potentially the most productive years of their lives, in front of a screen pressing buttons, shooting aliens or androids or pretending that they're playing the guitar when all they're doing is wasting their lives. Hey, if you want to play Stairway to Heaven you could learn to do it on a real guitar in less time than it seems most people are playing Guitar Hero!\n\nI do appreciated the help. You're right, I've only been on Reddit for a little while but I have been asking these kinds of questions for more than a decade. I don't want them to come off as hostile but in my experience when you ask about something a person really likes doing but doesn't know exactly why they're doing it (religion for example) they can get very defensive and angry in a very short time.

What is with all the competition for up votes? I have a sneaking suspicion that people generate multiple user names just to give themselves more upvotes and those with whom they disagree more downvotes. In all seriousness, how likely do you think that is?\n\nLastly, I'm flattered you asked about my friends. I think I have an average amount. None of them are gamers. Not one. I don't think any of my friends (or me for that matter) even have hobbies. We pretty much all work in fields that are very competitive and we can't spare an hour a day playing shoot-em-ups... I don't even have a television, I watch baseball games on the TV at the gym when I'm on the treadmill and listen to the news on the radio as I drive in to work. \n\nThis may sound snobbish but I couldn't even imagine building an adult friendship around a PS2 or an xbox... but that's just me, that's the way I roll...\n\nI do appreciate your helpful note though. It seems pretty rare in here.\n","c0hto3l":"Aside from the fact that this is fake due to the really weak reaction on the guy's part, if we assumed this *was* real, it would still be a ridiculously stupid idea on the girl's part.

Streaming video services are more convenient than torrents; They present 0 risk of being sued or having your internet cut off; they're more cost effective than overpriced rentals (which in some stores are approaching the cost of a new DVD! 10 bucks for an overnight rental? Thanks but no thanks!).\n\nI've spent hundreds of dollars on Steam as well, for the same reason.

But i kept going back and eventually met this cool guy, he introduced me to some chick, she's now also a good friend, and his girlfriend introduced me to my current roommate.  But you will not meet anyone in your living room.\n\nFinally, i mentioned hitting the gym, but if you hate the gym then find another physical activity you like, anything but make sure it's physical.  A good one would be a martial art.  It makes you meet new people and it's a good workout and useful.  Join a cycling team if you like riding bikes, figure out how to rock climb.\n\nFinally, and i know this is getting long.  Once youve met a few people, they may or may not form a 'group'.  This largely depends on you.  If you want people to want to be around you then you have to come up with ideas of things to do.  Organize paintball, pick a bar and decide to go, then invite people, or throw a party (if you dare).  Whatever it is, make sure you put yourself in the center of the action.  This way people know to go to you for fun.  Finally, never underestimate the attraction of game night with the ol xbox 360.  If you make it a group thing you can keep doing the things you love and not have to feel like a total loser all the time.\n\ntl;dr  lots of random advice in no particular order, pick and choose what you like.","c0hxunb":"Go get The Impossible Game on xbox live.

I don't see any of them regularly, and I'm only in contact with my sister because I've had yet another breakdown and am living at my father's house while recuperating.  To this day my mum believes I have an uncontrollable urge to fuck anything that moves.......despite the fact I have a big problem getting close to women and that it's obvious am not a lady magnet.  I'm going to to take your advice, because you're right; I did feel awful after dipping my toe in the waters this time.   I just feel the huge injustice of it all..............My younger sisters have had abortions, smoked cigarettes, taken drugs and have never been condemned by older sister, not a peep.  Me?  I got lectured for wearing an egyptian ankh and not having christian friends.  It just boils my blood that all the oppression is now forgotten about.  Most of this shit I can't even put into words.  It's just the constant criticism of things that don't even matter that makes me angry.  Once we both sneaked out to celebrate New Year's Eve.  I was 16 at the time.  As we were changing into our party clothes outside, I started laughing, because we got away with it.  She started lecturing me.  We both sneaked out, but I was in the wrong for being happy about it.  Living at home was just one constant dressing down.  Even though I was the top student at school, even though I went to the library at weekends.  Even though my hobbies were playing guitar and reading, my mother would STILL find fault with me for not spending my free time reading the bible.  By the time I hit my mid teens, my mum had the perfect child, literally.  Anything she asked me to do, I did.  I stopped talking at home, because there was no point.  Just no point.  I just gave up.  I was full of rage, and on some level my mum knew it.  If I wasn't studying I was sleeping.  Yet for some reason, my mum would threaten to throw me out of the house.  She would scream: If you're not studying, you can't stay here!!!!!  And yet all I would do was study!!!  She would hit me for eating my food too fast, send me out of the room for drinking water loudly.  She couldn't complain about my grades, so she would complain about my handwriting.  When my handwriting improved, there was nothing, absolutely nothing she could complain about school wise, so during parents evening at school she would take me aside and tell me that I got glowing school reports because the teachers felt sorry for me.  She would CONSTANTLY, CONSTANTLY berate us for watching tv.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  Weekend mornings would begin with her running from her room to smack us over the head for watching tv.  In the end, I just stopped watching tv at home because it wasn't worth getting hit for. What I didn't know was that this conditioning would have an affect on me later on in life.  At least once every six months, I get rid of my tv and xbox, because it's ''bad'' and that if I have free time I should be working.  I don't have a computer at my home for the same reason.   I realise where this behaviour comes from, but I can't seem to shake it.  It's like at the time I've had an epiphany; that all my troubles seem to stem from being seduced the evils of leisure time activities, even though I know these are echoes of my mum's rants, I truly believe that tv\/xbox\/internet is the root of all my depression etc.  Of course it never works.  Spending all day and evening working for months on end becoming a better musician just leads to a breakdown.  Fuck, I don't even know how I got onto this subject.\r\n","c0hz5h7":"I'm a woman who prefers to play male characters. It's not because I have anything against women or wish I was a man.

The cpu has 4 heat sinks but they are really cheap ones.\n\nThe temporary solution is to wrap it in towels, lots of towels, while the machine is on.  After a few hours, turn it off and unwrap it.  When you turn it back on, the sensor for overheating has been reset.\n\nThe permanent solution is to replace the 4 cheap heat sinks with better ones.  The youtube video I saw actually used 8 pennies wrapped in electrical tape (4 sets of 2), and stuck in place of the cheap heat sinks.\n\nThe only problem is that the replacement of the heat sinks involves taking apart the xbox completely, and losing any of the screws could mean it won't come back on.

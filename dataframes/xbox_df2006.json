Most of them are 4x so far. Since there aren't even singel speed drives available, it seems unlikely Sony would use them.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to costs, a large part of the investment has already been made, fabs and developing the Cell processor together with IBM and Toshiba.\r\n\r\nSony makes tons of money off the Playstation and Microsft loses billions on the xbox. To assume Sony would can it's bestseller seems a little weird.

What makes the Nintendo units special in my view is the software. Where the pobox (xbox) &amp; ps2 goes for the older gamers, Nintendo does a good job supplying games younger players can play. Thus concentrating on a segement that Sony touches on and Microsoft so far has ignored.","c5zhh":"I don't know about you fags, but I've never been more excited about gaming, and I've had every gaming system since 1983.\r\n\r\nUnless you own an xbox360, stfu, because you really have no clue what you are talking about.\r\n","c6f76":"\"I'm really not the dirty, xbox live cheater that you probably think i am! im just a weeeee little 13 year old.

I know people who are my age (25) who didn't go to college and work an hourly job, and people my age that are salaried. The aspirations are different. One group spends most of its free time just trying to have the most fun for their buck -- xbox, movies, mary jane, while the other group talks about investing, grad school, and expensive gadgets we still can't possibly afford but lust for. \r\n\r\nI'd sort of scared of introducing my friends who I like hanging out with that didn't go to college to the ones who did, but I have a feeling both side wouldn't relate beccause they have different perceptions of what is normal and mature for our age. The college educated group forgets that their parents had to work hard and sacrifice to send to them to college so they could compete in the modern world, and not everyone has parents so dedicated to their children, or fortunate parents.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm saying the middle class can get out of touch, too. Modded the article up. Feel free to mod me down.","caq3n":"I'd always wondered why the  SMB2 was so different from the original mario game.  Then a couple years ago I had learned that it was a totally different game with mario pasted into it.  By that time the game had been embedded into my psych enough to not really care, but it is a little disappointing. I'd never played the Lost Levels, but I have a modded xbox with about 800 SNES games so I'm hoping its in the pack.  As far as difficulty, although I beat it, the Doki Doki version I thought was the toughest SMB of them all.","cc2zi":"I \"work\" with them... and by work, I mean play X-Men: Legends for xbox all day every day.

The good graphics programmers care about it though, because enabling more parallel computations on the card leads to better performance.\r\n\r\nWhen the ps3 launces this november it will have 7 cores, and the xbox 360 has three. The PS2 has three processors (two vector units and on emain core). This is completely disregarding the graphics chips in the consoles which really constitute an extra core that truns a special sort of code, and the parallel tasks within the work done by the graphics card.","ckhyv":"It gets worse.

Ever.  I could be mistaken on this though.\r\n\r\nThe wii has never, and will never, be in the same league.  Nintendo saw two giants fighting a battle and decided to do something different.  It's like trying to compare a hummer and a jeep to a vw bug.  It's simply different. \r\n\r\nI've bitten Nintendo's magic apple and I'm fully taken in.  Graphics and raw cpu power don't matter.  The DS is deeply gutless and does just fine.  The games I spend most of my time on were made a decade ago.  It's all about the gameplay and not a lick about the graphics.\r\n\r\nMore power would be useful, but from an interview I heard with the designer their biggest goals were power consumption, efficency, and size.  The wii is more powerful than the old xbox, but not by much.  And if you look at the technical improvements they did focus on, they blow the competition away.\r\n\r\nIf Nintendo were to take away the profit they make on selling these things, I'd much rather they throw in a second controller than any more guts.","ctey5":"Just wait until the PS3 has been out for as long as the xbox360... then lets compare graphix","ctf42":"On the other hand, the wii has some really fun games and interesting new gameplay mechanics, and the xbox has... slightly prettier sequels to games we've all played dozens of copies of already.","ctjsh":"Gamer-news.org collects gamer news for all platforms, ps3, ps2, xbox, xbox360, pc, ds, wii and shows you all one one page so you dont have to crawl the pages yourself!","ctjsp":"Join the Ultimate Pro Evolution Soccer Fan site, as stated by Official Xbox Magazine 360.\r\n\r\nPlay in leagues and tournaments with our members over xbox live","ctmr8":"I remember this happening with Lasertag and other toy guns that were black in color...

What matters is what percentage of the population are gamers.\"\r\n\r\nThis is doubly true. Everyone's talking about how suddenly their 60 year old grandma is gaming again, thanks to the Wii.\r\n \r\nIn Japan, their 60 year old grandma never _stopped_ gaming. She's always had a handheld GBA or GBA SP. Or a game capable cell phone. And I'm not talking about something pathetic like the Ngage. \r\n\r\nPeople in the US probably won't get it. Halo, despite how much it sucks as a game, will be dear to so many people because it was there when they had their first LAN party. They would bring over the xbox to a friend's house who had a spare TV, and go at it, 4 on 4. \r\n\r\nHard-core gamers (not me) have been doing LAN parties for the past 10-15 years, and it just caught on in America with the release of the Xbox and Halo. \r\n\r\nFirst gen games might not have any problems with load times, but its a little quick to write off the Wii as a no-load time system. Zelda for GC takes something like 4 blocks on my memory card. Splinter Cell: Double Agent, likes 67 blocks, and its load time is much larger. \r\n\r\nAnd having a hard drive for saves instead of having to buy bigger and bigger memory cards is going to factor in the cost of the wii: do you want an upfront cost, or do you want hidden costs in your system?\r\n","cw8ry":"Halo isn't a good game. Combat Evolved != no cover. Halo combined the gameplay of the original quake with the graphics of Bungie -- 5 years AFTER it was supposed to originally ship for the Mac (but got bought out by MS, ported to xbox, etc). \r\n\r\nHave you even played Halo 2 on Xbox live?\r\n\r\nGears of War is what Halo should've been. Gears of War allows for actual things like 'tactics' and 'force multipliers'. Just like Battlefields 1 and 2 and Call of Duty. \r\n\r\nThe whole run screaming at your enemy to club them to death when you've got a perfectly good machine gun in your arms is what made the game weak. Its for meatheads.","cwktt":"You are confusing a \"de facto\" standard with non-proprietary.\r\n\r\nWindows is entrenched, but that doesn't make it open. It's still a proprietary system, just like OS\/2, the Mac, or the Amiga. Non-proprietary refers to standards and platforms anyone can create, not ones anyone can build apps for. \r\n\r\nAnyone can create a POSIX compatible Linux distribution, but its nearly impossible to create a working copy of Windows or its libraries, including DirectX. WINE and similar projects try, but after 10 years, its all still in beta.\r\n\r\nIt would be easier to copy Mac OS X than copy Windows. Both, however, are still proprietary.\r\n\r\nThe point you have the most trouble with is understanding that DirectX is the technology MS uses to tie the gaming industry to Windows. If it supported OpenGL, it would have to compete on its own merits, rather than hiding behind its monopoly.\r\n\r\nBut screw facts, you are an MS fan!
